    "content": "Stock indexes today are mixed.  Apple and Tesla are up more than +2% today to lead technology stocks higher.  However, gains in the broader market are limited by concern that the US labor market is weakening after the June ADP employment report showed that employment at US companies unexpectedly declined for the first time in more than two years.  Weakness in health insurance stocks is also weighing on the overall market, led by a -37% plunge in Centene after it withdrew its 2025 guidance due to insurance market trends that differed from its initial assumptions.\nThe markets are awaiting a House vote on the Senate version of President Trump’s tax and spending bill.  Also, trade talks are in focus ahead of the July 9 deadline for reciprocal tariff implementation.  Late Tuesday, President Trump said a trade deal with Japan is unlikely, so the country will most likely pay a tariff of 30%, 35% or “whatever the number is that we determine.”\nOn Tuesday, the Senate passed the Republican reconciliation bill by a 51-50 vote.  The bill is now being considered by the House, where a vote is expected sometime this week.  Speaker Johnson said the House “will work quickly” to pass the bill by July 4.  The reconciliation bill has the debt ceiling hike that is necessary to avert a Treasury default when the Treasury runs out of borrowing authority sometime between mid-August and late September.  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would add nearly $3.3 trillion to US budget deficits over the next decade.\nUS MBA mortgage applications rose +2.7% in the week ended June 27, with the purchase mortgage sub-index up +0.1% and the refinancing mortgage sub-index up +6.5%. The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell -9 bp to 6.79% from 6.88% in the prior week.\nThe US June ADP employment change unexpectedly fell -33,000, weaker than expectations of a +98,000 increase and the first decline in 2-1/4 years.\nOn the negative side for stocks is the upcoming earnings season, which begins next week. Bloomberg Intelligence data show that the consensus for Q2 earnings of S&P 500 companies is for a rise of +2.8% year-over-year, the smallest increase in two years.  Also, only six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research.\nDuring this holiday-shortened week, the markets will look for additional trade and tariff news along with progress in the possible passage of President Trump’s tax bill.  On Thursday, June nonfarm payrolls are expected to climb by +113,000, and the June employment rate is expected to tick up +0.1 to 4.3%.  Also, June average hourly earnings are expected to rise +0.3% m/m and +3.8% y/y. In addition, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb +5,000 to 241,000, and May factory orders are expected to jump +8.1% m/m.  Finally, the June ISM services index is expected to climb +0.7 to 50.6.\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances at 23% for a -25 bp rate cut at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting.\nOverseas stock markets today are mixed.  The Euro Stoxx 50 is up +0.36%.  China’s Shanghai Composite closed down -0.09%.  Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.56%.\nInterest Rates\nT-notes are under pressure today due to carryover weakness in European government bonds.  Also, speculation that Congress is close to passing President Trump’s tax and spending bill has sparked some weakness in T-note prices.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would add nearly $3.3 trillion to US deficits over the next decade, which would boost Treasury security sales to fund the deficits.  Rising inflation expectations are also undercutting T-note prices, as the 10-year breakeven inflation rate rose to a one-week high today at 2.319%.\nLosses in T-notes are limited after the June ADP employment change unexpectedly declined for the first time in more than two years, a dovish factor for Fed policy. Also, the weakness in stocks today has prompted some safe-haven demand for T-notes.\nEuropean government bond yields today are moving higher.  The 10-year German bund yield jumped to a 1-1/2 month high of 2.673% and is up +9.5 bp to 2.669%.  The 10-year UK gilt yield rose to a 3-week high of 4.633% and is up +16.6 bp to 4.620%.\nThe Eurozone May unemployment

    "link": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/see-which-latest-13f-filers-holds-aapl-0",
    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "content": "At Holdings Channel, we have reviewed the latest batch of the 20 most recent 13F filings for the 06/30/2025 reporting period, and noticed that Apple Inc (Symbol: AAPL) was held by 17 of these funds.  When hedge fund managers appear to be thinking alike, we find it is a good idea to take a closer look.\nBefore we proceed, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose their long positions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose their short positions.  A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position.  This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the story because the bearish/short side of the position is not seen.\nHaving given that caveat, we believe that looking at groups of 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another.  Below, let's take a look at the change in AAPL positions, for this latest batch of 13F filers:\nFund : New Position? : Change In Share Count : Change In Market Value ($ in 1000's)\nGP Brinson Investments LLC : Existing : UNCH : -$712\nStonehearth Capital Management LLC : Existing : -370 : -$349\nCullen Investment Group LTD. : Existing : +632 : -$3,448\nRowlandmiller & PARTNERS.ADV : Existing : +127 : -$2,285\nPrivate Client Services LLC : Existing : +8,272 : +$1,463\nBush Investment Group LLC : Existing : UNCH : -$100\nBancFirst Trust & Investment Management : Existing : UNCH : -$31\nStonebridge Capital Management Inc. : Existing : +50 : -$1,460\nBurkett Financial Services LLC : Existing : +18 : -$241\nKera Capital Partners Inc. : Existing : +4,086 : +$641\nFirst National Bank Sioux Falls : Existing : -2,127 : -$852\nLegacy Wealth Management LLC MS : Existing : -130,834 : -$30,916\nPark National Corp OH : Existing : -9,494 : -$10,229\nHarbor Investment Advisory LLC : Existing : -1,950 : -$6,081\nCacti Asset Management LLC : Existing : -85 : -$9,089\nNeville Rodie & Shaw Inc. : Existing : -28,169 : -$15,429\nCentral Pacific Bank Trust Division : Existing : -14,540 : -$4,533\nAggregate Change: : -174,384 : -$83,651\nIn terms of shares owned, we count 6 of the above funds having increased existing AAPL positions from 03/31/2025 to 06/30/2025, with 8 having decreased their positions.\nLooking beyond these particular funds in this one batch of most recent filers, we tallied up the AAPL share count in the aggregate among all of the funds which held AAPL at the 06/30/2025 reporting period (out of the 8,027 we looked at in total).  We then compared that number to the sum total of AAPL shares those same funds held back at the 03/31/2025 period, to see how the aggregate share count held by hedge funds has moved for AAPL.  We found that between these two periods, funds reduced their holdings by 155,458,710 shares in the aggregate, from 9,322,153,013 down to 9,166,694,303 for a share count decline of approximately -1.67%. The overall top three funds holding AAPL on 06/30/2025 were:\n» : Fund : Shares of AAPL Held\n1. : Vanguard Group Inc. : 1,400,790,809\n2. : BlackRock Inc. : 1,140,202,870\n3. : State Street Corp : 596,025,766\n4-10 : Find out the full Top 10 Hedge Funds Holding AAPL : »\nWe'll keep following the latest 13F filings by hedge fund managers and bring you interesting stories derived from a look at the aggregate information across groups of managers between filing periods.  While looking at individual 13F filings can sometimes be misleading due to the long-only nature of the information, the sum total across groups of funds from one reporting period to another can be a lot more revealing and relevant, providing interesting stock ideas that merit further research, like Apple Inc (Symbol: AAPL).\n10 S&P 500 Components Hedge Funds Are Buying »\n Institutional Holders of URRE\n\t OIH Historical Stock Prices\n\t NUAN Videos\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

    "content": "Chicago, IL – July 2, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Robinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD, Apple Inc. AAPL, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and Coinbase Global, Inc. COIN.\nHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:\nRobinhood Markets, Inc. stock surged 12.8% on Monday after launching new crypto offerings for European and U.S. users. The trading platform's shares have now spiked more than 300% in the past year, raising thoughts of a buying opportunity. Let's find out –\nRobinhood aims to become a comprehensive financial services company, not just a hub for meme stock traders. Crypto is expected to play a key role in achieving this goal. Robinhood is adding more than 200 U.S. stocks and ETF tokens, including Apple Inc. and NVIDIA Corp., to its platform in the EU to give European users access to American equities.\nTokenized stocks, popular among crypto enthusiasts, mimic underlying equities but utilize blockchain technology instead of traditional exchanges. Additionally, EU customers will have access to crypto perpetual futures for leveraged exposure to volatile assets. The company plans to introduce this product in the United States if crypto futures receive approval from the CFTC.\nRobinhood also launched crypto staking for U.S. users to expand its offerings and compete with crypto-native exchanges, such as Coinbase Global, Inc.. This feature will also be available to customers in the EU and the European Economic Area. Driven by these developments, Robinhood's shares have risen.\nTo tap into the booming cryptocurrency market, Robinhood acquired a cryptocurrency exchange, Bitstamp, for $200 million. This has enabled Robinhood to combine its cryptocurrency, options, and equities trading capabilities, establishing its status as an innovator in the finance field, which will boost the company's future valuations.\nAdditionally, trade tariffs led to increased volatility in the S&P 500, causing a rise in trading activity. These higher trading volumes improved Robinhood's first-quarter results, with revenues jumping 50% year over year to $927 million and earnings per share reaching 37 cents, up 106% year over year. The company's management also announced that they have seen strong customer engagement in the second quarter.\nIncreased customer engagement, Bitstamp acquisition, tokenized trading launch in the EU, and expanded crypto offerings are acting as tailwinds for Robinhood stock. In reality, Robinhood has a higher net profit margin of 48.8% than the Financial - Investment Bank industry's 16.1%, indicating strong growth potential.\nShares of Robinhood are currently trading above both the short-term 50-day moving average (DMA) and the long-term 200 DMA, further indicating a positive trend. Therefore, stakeholders are advised to retain their shares.\nRobinhood, however, is currently trading at a fairly hefty valuation. Per the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, Robinhood trades at 76.12 times forward earnings, while the industry's forward earnings multiple is 15.44. So, new buyers should be cautious because any lack of growth could lead to a major correction in Robinhood stock.\nFor now, Robinhood stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +48.4%, +50.2% and +56.7% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

    "content": "The three best-performing stocks on the S&P 500 index over the past three years, as of June 30, are Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) with a 1,403% return; Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), 1,116%; and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), 943%. The S&P 500 returned 71.6% over this period.\nBeyond all being artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, these three have one key commonality to which investors should give more attention: They're led by a founder-CEO.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang during his 2025 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) keynote address. Screenshot by author.\nCompany : Founded : IPO* Year : Dates Led by a Founder\nPalantir : 2003 : 2020** : Founding to present\nSupermicro : 1993 : 2007 : Founding to present\nNvidia : 1993 : 1999 : Founding to present\nData sources: Various company data. IPO = initial public offering. **Palantir had a direct listing rather than a traditional IPO.\nPalantir stock's powerful performance has been driven by strong demand for the company's AI-powered software platforms for data analytics. The company sells to both government and commercial clients. Co-founder Alex Karp is its CEO.\nShares of Supermicro, as the company is commonly called, have had a super run-up thanks to robust demand for the company's servers optimized for AI applications. Founder Charles Liang is CEO.\nNvidia stock's stellar gains have been fueled by ferocious demand for the company's market-leading graphics processing unit (GPU) chips for training AI models and running AI applications. Co-founder Jensen Huang is CEO.\nIt might not be just coincidental that the three biggest S&P stock winners over the last three years are all led by one of the company's founders. Studies show that founder-led companies tend to outperform the market over the long term.\nThis makes common sense. Nobody -- not even the most loyal, hardest working person -- is going to care as much about a company's success as its founders, or at least its founders that are still involved with the company. It's likely a lot of their ego is tied up in the success of their companies -- and that can be a powerful motivating force.\nI recall Nvidia CEO Huang saying in an interview years ago that he was either working or thinking about work whenever he wasn't working.\nAnd many of us have probably heard that Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has slept at the electric vehicle (EV) pioneer's factories during critical times, such as during retooling. (While Musk isn't technically a Tesla founder, he's legally considered one. For all intents and purposes, he's acted as a founder, as he joined the company in its early days and invested huge sums of money to keep it going.)\nThere are many factors that make a stock a good investment, so I'm certainly not suggesting that folks only invest in founder-led companies. That would leave out a huge number of well-established companies that have succeeded over many decades or even over a century.\nWhat I am suggesting is that you consider the question, \"Is this company led by a founder?\" when you're contemplating investing in a company that's young enough that it could have a founder-CEO. This factor would just be one consideration in your investing decision.\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" are Big Tech companies that are widely considered the market's current leaders in driving technological innovation. Their stocks have all outperformed the market -- some have absolutely crushed it -- over the long term.\nThat all seven of them have had decent-length periods in which they were led by one of their founders lends support to the theory that founder-led companies tend to outperform over the long term.\nA partner at Bain & Company, a top management consulting firms, wrote this on the topic in the Harvard Business Review: \"[H]ow founders built their companies on the inside, from the start, influenced their companies' success on the outside, for a long time.\" [Emphasis mine.]\nMagnificent Seven Company : Founded : IPO* Year : Dates Led By a Founder\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) : 1976 : 1980 : 1997 to 2011\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) : 1975 : 1986 : Founding to 2000\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) : 1994 : 1997 : Founding to 2021\nNvidia : 1993 : 1999 : Founding to present\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) : 1998 : 2004 : Founding to 2001, and 2011 to 2015\nTesla : 2003 : 2010 : 2008 to present**\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) : 2004 : 2012 : Founding to present\nData sources: Various company sources and Wikipedia. IPO = initial public offering. Listed in order of IPO date. **Tesla CEO Elon Musk was on the company's board and its chief product architect beginning in 2004 and a major early investor before becoming CEO in 2008.\nApple is unique among this group in that one of its founders -- Steve Jobs -- didn't become CEO for many years (about two decades) after the founding. But he led Apple during its most innovative period during which it released the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, and set the stage for the stock's strong, sustained run-up.\nIn short, studies show founder-led companies tend to outperform the market over the long term -- and investors should use this knowledge in their stock-picking.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $722,181!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $968,402!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,069% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 177% for the S&P 500.

    "link": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/22-warren-buffetts-285-billion-portfolio-invested-these-2-magnificent-seven-artificial",
    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "content": "Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett is one of history's most successful investors, and his expertise when it comes to identifying fantastic long-term opportunities has delivered incredible returns for his company's shareholders. Notably, Buffett has been famously averse to investing in the tech sector for most of his tenure as Berkshire's leader -- but that's changed a lot in recent years.\nWhile Buffett has been cautious when it comes to tech companies due to the inherent complexities involved with many of the underlying businesses, Berkshire's approach to the sector has shifted significantly over the last decade. In fact, just two top companies in the artificial intelligence (AI) space account for roughly 22% of Berkshire's $279 billion in public stock holdings as of this writing. Read on for a closer look at how Buffett and Berkshire are approaching tech-sector investing and AI trends right now.\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\nKeith Noonan (Apple): Warren Buffett has famously said that his favorite holding period for a stock is \"forever,\" but it's still not unusual to see Berkshire Hathaway make some significant adjustments when it comes to exposure to individual companies in its portfolio. Even so, the investment conglomerate's moves to lessen its position in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have been eye-catching -- particularly as massive selling moves have taken place as the AI revolution has been heating up.\nAt the peak, Berkshire held 915 million shares of Apple stock -- and its investment in the tech giant sometimes accounted for more than half of its total public stock holdings. Berkshire still holds 300 million Apple shares, but it sold 605 million shares across last year's trading and sold roughly 10 million shares in Q4 2023. Apple stands as Berkshire's top stock holding and accounts for roughly 21.2% of its portfolio, but Berkshire's moves to reduce its exposure still raise some questions.\nBerkshire has also made some big selling moves with Bank of America, Chevron, and other stocks that have been mainstays in its stock portfolio. The moves appear to reflect valuation concerns about the broader market -- and it's possible that macroeconomic and geopolitical risk factors have influenced Berkshire's strategy.\nEven so, it's also a realistic possibility that Berkshire's analysts have seen some warning signs when it comes to Apple's position in the AI race. While Nvidia has scored massive wins thanks to demand for its AI-focused graphics processing units and Microsoft has seen major demand tailwinds connected to the rise of artificial intelligence software, Apple's victories in the category have been more muted.\nThe company's iPhone hardware is still its biggest performance driver, but the rollout of the Apple Intelligence software platform has yet to move the needle in a big way. In fact, Apple Intelligence actually wound up indirectly hurting the sales of iPhone 16s in China because Apple had not secured a local partner to collaborate with on the software and fulfill Chinese regulatory requirements. As a result, the iPhone 16 lines launched without support for Apple Intelligence at a time when Chinese customers were seeking AI-enabled devices and already showing a preference for domestic brands. There's still a good chance that Apple will be able to land big wins in the AI space, but the company has some proving to do.\nJennifer Saibil (Amazon): Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) makes up a tiny percentage of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio at just 0.7%, but it presents incredible opportunities.\nAmazon is the largest cloud services company in the world, with 30% of the market according to Statista. It has a strong lead against the next-largest competitor, Microsoft Azure, which has 23% of the market.\nTo keep its lead and stay ahead in the game, Amazon is investing more than $100 billion in its AI platform in 2025 alone. It has already launched thousands of features and services to meet demand at every end of the scale, from large clients that are creating their own custom large-language models to small business clients that need easy, plug-in solutions. It partners with AI chip giant Nvidia, but it's also releasing its own cheaper options for its budget-conscious clients.\nIt already has several premier tools for developers, such as Bedrock, in what it calls the middle layer between fully custom and plug-in. It gives developers many options to customize LLMs for their specific purposes, and SageMaker, which can create code from prompts, debug, and more.\nCEO Andy Jassy has stressed several times that 85% of IT spend is still on premises, and that there's going to be a shift to the cloud. That should create a windfall for Amazon, which is in the best position to benefit from that shift. \"AI represents, for sure, the biggest opportunity since cloud and probably the biggest technology shift and opportunity in business since the internet,\" he said. He envisions AI becoming a core component of every app being developed, like storage and databases. As more clients want to benefit from the generative AI revolution, Amazon is drawing more business to AWS for its regular cloud services, too.\nEven though Amazon is already the second-largest U.S. company by sales and the fourth by market cap, it has tons of opportunity in AI, and it may only be a matter of time before it reaches the No. 1 spot in both.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $722,181!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $968,402!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,069% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 177% for the S&P 500.

    "content": "(RTTNews) - Microsoft has announced plans to lay off around 9,000 employees — representing less than 4% of its global workforce — as part of a sweeping reorganization aimed at streamlining its structure and boosting efficiency.\nThe layoffs, revealed on the second day of the company's 2026 fiscal year, will impact teams across multiple business units and regions, a source told CNBC.\n\"Organizational changes are necessary to position the company and its teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement.\nThe tech giant has conducted several rounds of layoffs this year, cutting less than 1% of staff in January, more than 6,000 in May, and at least 300 in June. Its workforce stood at 228,000 as of June.\nIn the Xbox division, significant cuts include the closure of The Initiative studio and the cancellation of high-profile titles such as Perfect Dark and Everwild.\nMatt Booty, president of game content and studios, acknowledged the tough decisions in an internal memo, citing the need to reprioritize resources in a rapidly evolving gaming industry. Turn 10 Studios, developer of Forza Motorsport, was also affected.\nDespite the cuts, Microsoft continues to report strong financials, posting $26 billion in net income on $70 billion in revenue for the March quarter. Executives expect 14% year-over-year revenue growth in the June quarter, driven by Azure cloud services and productivity software.\nMicrosoft shares recently hit a record high, but the company, like many tech peers, is trimming layers of management and shifting resources toward its most strategic growth areas as economic and competitive pressures mount.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "content": "Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC)(NYSE: BEP) has been a wealth-creating machine over the years. The leading global renewable energy producer has grown its dividend at a 6% compound annual rate since 2001. That has helped power a 15.6% average annual total return for its investors.\nWhile that past performance doesn't guarantee its future returns will be as strong, the company's current outlook suggests the next 10 years could be just as good, if not better. If Brookfield can deliver similar returns over that period, it could grow a $1,000 investment made this July into more than $4,250 by the middle of 2035.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nBrookfield Renewable currently pays a dividend yielding around 4.5%. That's more than three times higher than the S&P 500, which yields less than 1.5%. Brookfield's high-yielding dividend provides investors with a very strong base return.\nThat payout is on a very sustainable foundation. Brookfield sells 90% of its electricity under long-term, fixed-rate power purchase agreements (PPAs) with an average remaining term of 14 years. Most of those PPAs link rates to inflation, accounting for 70% of Brookfield's revenue and allowing the company to produce predictable and steadily rising cash flow. Brookfield estimates that inflation-linked rate increases will boost its funds from operations (FFO) by 2% to 3% per share each year.\nThe market price for renewable energy is rising faster than inflation because of robust demand, and Brookfield expects to lock in even higher power prices as legacy PPAs expire. Recontracting and other margin enhancement activities should add another 2% to 4% to its FFO per share each year.\nThe stable and growing cash flow from Brookfield's existing portfolio puts its high-yielding dividend on a solid foundation. The company also has a strong investment-grade balance sheet, further fortifying its payout.\nBrookfield Renewable has two other growth drivers: Development projects and acquisitions. The company has 74 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy projects in its advanced-stage pipeline. That's almost double its current operating capacity of nearly 45 GW. It expects to commission 8 GW of projects this year as it ramps up to its target of 10 GW annually by 2027. Brookfield estimates that development projects will add 4% to 6% to its FFO per share each year.\nThe company is steadily signing PPAs to support its development pipeline. It inked a massive 10.5 GW deal with Microsoft last year for projects it expects to develop in the 2026-to-2030 timeframe. Brookfield believes it could eventually provide the technology company with even more power in the future, given the immense demand for electricity needed to power AI data centers.\nIn addition, Brookfield expects to continue making accretive acquisitions largely funded by recycling capital. The company recently closed its acquisition of French renewable energy developer Neoen, which enhanced its development pipeline in several fast-growing markets. It also recently agreed to buy National Grid's U.S. onshore renewable-energy platform. That deal will add 3.9 GW of operating and under construction assets, a 1 GW construction-ready portfolio, and more than 30 GW of development projects. It's funding these new investments by selling several assets at strong valuations. Brookfield believes that its capital recycling strategy will further accelerate its growth rate.\nBrookfield estimates that this quartet of catalysts will grow its FFO per share at more than a 10% annual rate for the foreseeable future. That growth is highly visible and secured through the end of the decade, and increasingly visible and secured in 2030 and beyond.\nBrookfield Renewable's high-yielding dividend provides a solid and growing base return. It's targeting 5% to 9% annual dividend increases. On top of that, the company expects to grow its FFO per share at more than a 10% annual rate for at least the next decade. It has delivered 11% compound annual growth over the past 10 years. Add the dividend yield to the company's growth rate, and Brookfield could deliver total returns above 15% annually. That strong probability of earning a high total return makes Brookfield Renewable a great stock to invest $1,000 into this July.\nBefore you buy stock in Brookfield Renewable, consider this:\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $697,627!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $939,655!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,045% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 178% for the S&P 500. Don’t miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.\n*Stock Advisor returns as of June 30, 2025\nMatt DiLallo has positions in Brookfield Renewable and Brookfield Renewable Partners.

    "link": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/meet-monster-quantum-computing-stock-continues-crush-ionq-rigetti-computing-and-nvidia",
    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "content": "Over the last couple of years, investors have witnessed a sharp rise in certain pockets of the technology realm thanks to rising interest in artificial intelligence (AI). Companies operating across industries such as semiconductors, enterprise software, and cloud computing have been particular beneficiaries of AI investment so far.\nWithin the last year, however, quantum computing stocks have started to emerge as a new trend fueling the AI revolution.\nIonQ, Rigetti Computing, and even Nvidia are common names surrounding the quantum computing narrative. However, what if I told you there is another quantum computing stock that has outperformed all three of the leaders above?\nAs of the closing bell on June 27, shares of D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS) have gained 67% so far this year -- absolutely trouncing the performances of its peers.\nLet's explore the driving force behind D-Wave's monster price action and assess if now is a good opportunity to scoop up some shares.\nWhile quantum computing is not yet widely commercialized, technology enthusiasts have become interested in its development due to its advantages over classic computers. Quantum computers are believed to possess superior processing power compared to today's most sophisticated computers.\nIn theory, this could lead to greater efficiency advantages in solving complex problems across industries such as energy, financial services, and pharmaceuticals. Global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company estimates that quantum computing could generate $1.3 trillion in economic value by the middle of next decade.\nConsidering that the world's largest AI developers such as Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, and Nvidia are all building quantum computing hardware and software, I'm optimistic that the opportunity could be quite lucrative in the long run.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nThe charts below illustrate growth in D-Wave's revenue and cash balance over the last year. As indicated by the steep slope of each line, D-Wave's growth appears to be hitting a new stride.\nQBTS Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\nWith first-quarter revenue soaring by 509% year over year and ample cash on the balance sheet, I suspect some investors are looking past some subtle nuances from the financial profile above and pouring into D-Wave stock.\nSmart investors understand this magnitude of growth is less impressive considering D-Wave only generated $15 million of sales during the quarter. With that in mind, it becomes clear that the majority of D-Wave's revenue base over the last 12 months was concentrated in a single quarter. To me, this makes the company's ongoing trajectory somewhat uncertain and potentially lumpy given the lack of scale D-Wave has achieved so far.\nMoreover, despite its small revenue figures, D-Wave's cash balance skyrocketed by about $126 million during the first quarter. Per the company's 10Q filing, D-Wave raised this capital through an at-the-money (ATM) offering.\nAnother way of looking at this is that D-Wave is not yet generating profitability that it can reinvest back into the business. Rather, the company is taking advantage of its rising stock price by issuing new shares at an inflated valuation in order to raise capital.\nAs of this writing, D-Wave boasts a market capitalization of roughly $4.5 billion. Given the company's trailing-12-month sales of just $21 million, this implies that D-Wave trades for a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of about 150.\nAs the chart below illustrates, D-Wave's P/S ratio is roughly 4 times higher than some of the peak multiples investors witnessed in names such as Amazon and Cisco during the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s.\nQBTS PS Ratio data by YCharts\nNot only do I think D-Wave's valuation is unsustainable, but management may think so, too.\nAccording to recent filings, D-Wave is considering raising an additional $400 million through subsequent stock issuances. In my eyes, a move like this could suggest that management understands that the company's stock is overbought, and therefore is willing to dilute shareholders in order to take advantage of a frothy, overstretched valuation to raise additional funds.\nWhile I understand the excitement surrounding quantum computing, I think shares of D-Wave Quantum have gotten ahead of themselves. The company is trading for a premium valuation, despite being a highly speculative opportunity at this time.\nI would pass on investing in D-Wave Quantum stock right now and instead opt for more established companies with strong footholds in the AI landscape.\nBefore you buy stock in D-Wave Quantum, consider this:\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $697,627!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $939,655!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,045% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 178% for the S&P 500.

    "title": "3 Best AI Stocks to Buy in July",
    "link": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-best-ai-stocks-buy-july",
    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "content": "Traditional metrics say tech stocks are expensive -- and by old-world standards, they are. But that view misses the larger truth: This isn't a bubble. It's the dawn of a new economic epoch -- the beginning of a fundamentally different era for humanity.\nBy early definitions, artificial general intelligence (AGI) -- systems capable of performing a broad range of cognitive tasks at human levels -- may already exist in a primitive form. Yet, markets continue to value the companies building this future with frameworks rooted in the pre-AI era.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nThat disconnect between technological reality and investor perception presents a rare opportunity for those willing to look beyond quarterly earnings. Here's a look at three tech titans poised to lead the charge.\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has soared more than 1,600% over the past five years and recently hit a new all-time high of $154.31 in June 2025, capping a sharp rebound from its April lows. Despite a $4.5 billion Q1 charge tied to the H20 chip ban in China -- and a projected $8 billion revenue hit in Q2 -- Nvidia crushed fiscal Q1 2026 earnings estimates, proving its resilience in the face of geopolitical headwinds.\nNine of the 10 most powerful supercomputers now run on Nvidia's chips. With hyperscalers expected to invest up to $320 billion in AI infrastructure this year -- up $90 billion from 2024 -- Nvidia remains the clear linchpin of the AI build-out. Loop Capital's Ananda Baruah recently raised his price target to $250, the highest on Wall Street, implying a potential market cap of $6 trillion (up from $3.6 trillion today).\nThe bear case focuses on intensifying competition and its lofty valuation. But with gross margin at 71.3% (ex-China impact) and Blackwell architecture scaling, Nvidia's pricing power remains unchallenged. Trading at 24.7x projected 2028 earnings, the stock isn't cheap -- but true category kings rarely are.\nASML (NASDAQ: ASML) holds a near-monopoly on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, which are ultra-high-tech tools costing between $200 million and $400 million. These machines are essential for producing the most advanced chips, making ASML a critical bottleneck in the global semiconductor supply chain.\nIn the first quarter of 2025, ASML reported strong financial results, with net sales of 7.7 billion euros and a gross margin of 54%, both exceeding the company's guidance. A significant milestone was the shipment of its fifth High NA EUV machine, with these cutting-edge systems now deployed at three different customers, indicating increasing adoption of its most advanced technology.\nWhile ASML adjusted its annual revenue growth forecast from a mid-40% range to the mid-teens, it still projects robust sales of 30 billion to 35 billion euros for 2025, representing a substantial increase of 7% to 25% from 2024. This revised outlook, stemming from ASML's guidance, still positions the company favorably within the semiconductor equipment sector. Analysts in this sector anticipate total spending on semiconductor equipment to rise to $110 billion to $121 billion in 2025, up 2% to 7% year over year, further solidifying ASML's dominant position in a growing market.\nASML is expected to capture a significant share of this market due to its exclusive position in EUV technology. Trading at approximately 21.9 times projected 2027 earnings, the stock offers investors rare exposure to a technological monopoly at a valuation considered reasonable, especially given its strong long-term tailwinds driven by increasing demand for advanced chips.\nFurthermore, a key strategic advantage for ASML is its ability to continue shipping EUV tools globally, including to China, under existing export-control exemptions. This differentiates ASML from many U.S. chip-equipment makers facing stricter restrictions, thereby reinforcing its strong market position and global reach.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) hit fresh record highs in June 2025, closing at $467.68 and briefly reclaiming its crown as the world's most valuable company with a $3.48 trillion market cap. The company's fiscal Q3 2025 results -- released on April 30 -- demonstrated continued strength in cloud and AI integration, with total revenue up 13% year over year to $70.1 billion and net income rising 18% to $25.8 billion.\nThe key driver: Azure and other cloud services, which grew 33% year over year (35% in constant currency), with AI services contributing 7 percentage points to that growth. Microsoft 365 Copilot continues to scale across enterprise and consumer products, embedding AI into Word, Excel, Outlook, and Teams. Meanwhile, the company's strategic partnership with OpenAI strengthens its position in foundational AI infrastructure and applications.\nMicrosoft remains one of only two companies in the world with a perfect AAA credit rating from both S&P Global and Moody's. It has roughly twice as much cash as long-term debt, giving it one of the strongest balance sheets in the market. This financial fortress enables Microsoft to invest aggressively in AI while maintaining the highest dividend yield among the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" tech giants.\nTrading at approximately 28.5 times projected 2027 earnings and growing earnings per share at an estimated 10% annually, Microsoft offers rare stability through its broad diversification, consisting of key growth vectors like cloud, productivity software, gaming (Xbox, Activision), and professional networking (LinkedIn). Unlike pure-play AI start-ups that hinge on singular breakthroughs, Microsoft generates AI revenue across a layered, global product ecosystem.\nThe AI market is projected to grow from $294 billion in 2025 to $1.77 trillion by 2032. These three companies control critical choke points in this transformation. For investors willing to look beyond quarterly volatility, they offer exposure to technology's most important trend. The future won't wait for the skeptics to catch up.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $697,627!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $939,655!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,045% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 178% for the S&P 500.

    "link": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/palantirs-ai-platform-moves-hype-hyper-execution",
    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "content": "Palantir Technologies PLTR, a pioneer in big data and artificial intelligence, is experiencing a sharp increase in enterprise momentum, driven by the rapid growth of its Artificial Intelligence Platform (“AIP”). The platform is swiftly becoming the company’s most compelling growth driver within the enterprise landscape, transforming how organizations harness AI at scale.\nThe adoption of AIP is accelerating at a rapid pace. In the first quarter of 2025, U.S. commercial revenues surged an impressive 71% year over year and rose 19% sequentially. This helped Palantir cross a significant threshold, achieving a $1 billion annual revenue run rate in this segment for the first time. The total contract value within U.S. commercial operations soared 239% from the prior-year level. Notably, the number of deals exceeding $1 million more than doubled year over year, signaling growing enterprise trust and larger platform footprints.\nPalantir’s strategic deployment of AIP bootcamps — high-impact, intensive training sessions —has played a critical role in this acceleration. These programs are designed to help enterprise customers quickly and efficiently integrate AIP into their workflows. The results are compelling — clients are deploying production-grade AI solutions faster than ever, significantly shortening time-to-value and showcasing the platform’s intuitive design and real-world readiness.\nAt its core, AIP empowers organizations to embed autonomous AI agents across operations, compressing decision cycles and multiplying productivity, not in increments, but in orders of magnitude. While the broader market remains preoccupied with the evolution of AI model development, PLTR is carving out dominance on the deployment side, delivering plug-and-play, enterprise-ready solutions that produce measurable impact from day one. U.S. commercial operations have emerged as Palantir’s most energized growth engine, and AIP works as the catalyst.\nTech giants like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet’s GOOGL Google, and Salesforce CRM are deepening their commitment to generative AI. Microsoft continues to embed Copilot into its Office suite and expand AI capabilities through Azure, while also investing in robust AI governance frameworks. Google enhances its AI portfolio through Workspace and Vertex AI, and intensifies its focus on AI security and compliance. Meanwhile, Salesforce is integrating AI across its customer relationship management stack with Einstein Copilot and Data Cloud, while also innovating in personalized, real-time customer experiences.\nDespite the innovations from Microsoft, Google and Salesforce, Palantir remains a distinctive entity. Its strength lies in high-stakes, mission-critical environments, particularly defense, intelligence, and healthcare, where trust, security, and outcomes matter most. In a crowded field, Palantir stands apart, not by competing in volume or visibility, but by consistently delivering AI where it counts most.\nThe stock has surged a whopping 73% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 17.5% rally.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, PLTR trades at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 111.72, well above the industry’s 7.22. It carries a Value Score of F.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for PLTR’s earnings has been on the rise over the past 60 days.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPLTR stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nOur team of experts has just released the 5 stocks with the greatest probability of gaining +100% or more in the coming months. Of those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian highlights the one stock set to climb highest.\nThis top pick is a little-known satellite-based communications firm. Space is projected to become a trillion dollar industry, and this company's customer base is growing fast. Analysts have forecasted a major revenue breakout in 2025. Of course, all our elite picks aren't winners but this one could far surpass earlier Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Hims & Hers Health, which shot up +209%.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

    "link": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-have-quietly-outperformed-market-all-year",
    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "content": "Some artificial intelligence (AI) stocks inspire tons of headlines. You probably know exactly what Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are doing in the AI space, whether their stocks are doing well or not.\nAnd then there's the quiet bunch. I can assure you that IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) do plenty of AI-related business, and that they stand to benefit from this ongoing boom in generative AI. Their stocks have been outperforming the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) in 2025, apart from a couple of short-lived glitches.\nBut how often do you see them mentioned among the top AI stocks to own for the long haul? Not a whole lot, I bet.\nSo let me tell you what these tech veterans are doing to earn consistently market-beating performance this year -- without dominating the press.\nMicron is not the largest memory-chip maker in the world, but it has an advantage over sector leaders SK Hynix and Samsung (OTC: SSNL.F) right now. The Idaho-based chip maker is first to market with the fourth generation of high bandwidth memory (HBM) -- a key component in the latest and greatest AI accelerator platforms.\nSamsung and Hynix have their own HBM4 solutions, but Micron is already shipping these chips to its most important customers. AI hardware leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) includes Micron's HBM4 memory on its Blackwell family of AI accelerators. Runner-up AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) also selected Micron's top-of-the-line memory for its next two generations of Instinct accelerators.\nAs a result, Micron's market share is growing while Samsung is sliding back. Now, Micron's sales are limited by the company's in-house production capacity, as the HBM chips are sold out for the rest of 2025. That's why Micron has invested $10.2 billion in capital expenses over the last three quarters, up from $5.3 billion in the same year-ago period. These costly chip-factory upgrades will be the foundation of Micron's long-term growth opportunity.\nSo Micron is a leading supplier of AI-grade memory solutions. The stock has gained a market-beating 47% in the first half of 2025. Now you know why.\nDo you still see IBM as a one-stop shop for corporate computing needs? That would be a mistake. The company refocused on AI, cloud computing, and consulting services long before it was cool. The strategy shift led to many years of disappointing shareholder returns, but the big payoff is finally coming in. And of course, Big Blue's fortunes are built around AI.\nIn the recent first-quarter update, IBM posted an order book of more than $6 billion in the WatsonX generative AI service. That's up from roughly $1 billion in the year-ago quarter. That's a big jump. And here's the fun part -- only 20% of this incoming contract portfolio comes from software licenses. The rest springs from consulting services.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nThis is a unique business advantage. IBM's technical expertise goes far beyond its own software tools. When your company's employees need training on a new technology, or hands-on expertise from IT consultants, you're likely to look at IBM's consulting services. Yes, other tech giants can support their in-house software and services, but they're less likely to offer broad technology support.\nThis isn't a new trend. Before the Fool, two different employers sent me to IBM's training centers around the country to keep me up to date with networking standards and programming tools. That was 20 years ago and nothing has changed -- except IBM's heavier focus on high-value topics such as AI systems and cloud computing.\nIBM's stock has gained 33% in 2025, and the underlying business results were largely based on consulting services in the AI market. If you knew that five minutes ago, you were already ahead of the game. If not, you just earned an edge on most AI investors.\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $722,181!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $968,402!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,069% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 177% for the S&P 500.

You can read this article for free on our home page and can actually sign up there to get an email notification as this article comes out each morning.\nYou can read today's AWS here >>> Plenty of Data to Start 2nd Half of 2025\nShares of Alphabet have underperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the year-to-date period (-7.7% vs. -4.4%). The company's increasing litigation issues are a concern. Intensifying competition from Microsoft and Amazon in cloud computing is a headwind.\nNevertheless, Alphabet is riding on strong cloud and search growth. Google Cloud is benefiting from accelerated growth across AI infrastructure, enterprise AI platform Vertex and strong adoption of Generative AI solutions. The company expects capital expenditures in 2025 to be relatively higher than in 2024, aimed at building technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers and networking.\nAlphabet's dominant position in the search engine market is a strong growth driver. In first-quarter 2025, GOOGL saw continued double-digit revenue growth in Search. Alphabet surpassed 270 million paid subscriptions with YouTube and Google One as key drivers.\n(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)\nAbbVie's shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (+6.2% vs. -0.6%). The company has successfully navigated Humira's loss of exclusivity (LOE) by launching two other successful new immunology medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which are performing extremely well -- bolstered by approvals in new indications and should support top-line growth in the next few years.\nAbbVie has several early/mid-stage candidates that have the potential to drive long-term growth. It expects to return to robust revenue growth in 2025, which is just the second year following the U.S. Humira LOE. AbbVie has been on an acquisition spree, mainly in its core space of immunology.\nHowever, the company faces several near-term headwinds like Humira LOE impact, increasing competitive pressure on Imbruvica and slowing sales of its aesthetics franchise.\n(You can read the full research report on AbbVie here >>>)\nShares of Walt Disney have gained +11.5% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry's gain of +14.7%. The company is benefiting from strength in Domestic Parks & Experiences revenues driven by growth at domestic parks, Disney Vacation Club and Disney Cruise Line, partially offset by decline at international locations including\nShanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. In Entertainment, DIS expects double-digit segment operating income growth in fiscal 2025. The Zacks analyst expects fiscal 2025 net sales to increase 3.7% from fiscal 2024.\nHowever, Disney+'s profitability is expected to be hurt by higher investments in content, which will also increase programming and production costs in the Entertainment segment. For fiscal Q3, Disney expects a modest increase in its Disney+ subscriber base on a sequential basis. Disney's declining ad revenues is an overhang. The company's leveraged balance sheet remains a concern.\n(You can read the full research report on Walt Disney here >>>)\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

For 2020, the Focus List gained 13.85% on an annualized basis compared to the S&P 500's return of 9.38%. Cumulatively, the portfolio has returned 2,519.23% while the S&P returned 854.95%. Returns are for the period of February 1, 1996 to March 31, 2021.\nWhen stocks are picked for the Focus List, it reflects our enduring reliance on the power of earnings estimate revisions.\nBrokerage analysts are in charge of determining a company's growth and profitability expectations, or earnings estimates. These analysts work together with company management to evaluate all factors that may affect future earnings, like interest rates, the economy, and sector and industry optimism.\nEarnings estimate revisions are very important, since investors also need to take into consideration what a company will earn in the future.\nStocks that receive upward earnings estimate revisions are more likely to receive even more upward changes in the future. For example, if an analyst raised their estimates last month, they're more likely to do it again this month, and other analysts are likely to do the same.\nUtilizing the power of earnings estimate revisions is when the Zacks Rank joins the party. A unique, proprietary stock-rating model, the Zacks Rank uses changes to quarterly earnings expectations to help investors create a winning portfolio.\nThe Zacks Rank consists of four main pillars: Agreement, Magnitude, Upside, and Surprise. Each one is given a raw score, which is recalculated every night and compiled into the Rank. Then, stocks are classified into five groups, ranging from \"Strong Buy\" to \"Strong Sell,\" using this data.\nThe Focus List is comprised of stocks hand-picked from a long list of #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) ranked companies, meaning that each new addition boasts a bullish earnings consensus among analysts.\nIt can be very profitable to buy stocks with rising earnings estimates, as stock prices respond to revisions. By adding Focus List stocks, there's a great chance you'll be getting into companies whose future earnings estimates will be raised, which can lead to price momentum.\nAlphabet is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily being a search-engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare providers and others. In the online search arena, Google has a monopoly with more than 94% of the online search volume and market.\nGOOGL, a #3 (Hold) stock, was added to the Focus List on May 19, 2025 at $166.19 per share. Since then, shares have increased 5.81% to $175.84.\nFor fiscal 2025, two analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.04 to $9.53. GOOGL boasts an average earnings surprise of 14.6%.\nAdditionally, GOOGL's earnings are expected to grow 18.5% for the current fiscal year.\nUnlock all of our powerful research, tools and analysis, including the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research Reports, Zacks Earnings ESP Filter, Premium Screener and more, as part of Zacks Premium.

    "link": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-my-top-autonomous-driving-stock-hint-its-not-tesla",
    "ticker": "GOOGL",
    "content": "Autonomous driving has been in the news quite a bit lately, with Tesla launching its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. While I think Tesla is a great pick in this space, there's one that I like more at the moment. That's Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL).\nAlphabet is known as the parent company of Google, but it also owns Waymo, the undisputed leader in autonomous driving right now (at least in terms of deployed footprint). Alphabet is my top autonomous driving stock, and investors can essentially acquire it for free, given Alphabet's current stock price.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nWaymo is currently available in five cities: Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Francisco, Atlanta, and Austin. As the robotaxi expands its footprint in Austin, it will be an interesting study on how consumers choose one over the other. This is a battle to keep an eye on, and the winner here could be a wake-up call for the loser.\nFurther expansions are also planned in Miami and Washington, D.C. Washington, D.C., is probably the most intriguing location on this list, as it has one key factor in common with the other six cities: It snows. If it can conquer this tricky element to drive in, that can open up Waymo to some very lucrative markets, such as New York City and Chicago, the largest and third-largest metropolitan populations in the U.S. (Los Angeles is the second-largest).\nWaymo's footprint gives it a significant lead in the autonomous driving space, but Tesla could eventually catch up due to its cost advantage. Although information about the cost of a Waymo vehicle isn't publicly available, some estimates place the cost as high as $200,000 per vehicle. That's far more expensive than a Tesla, and although Waymo can likely bring that price down, it will be some time before it costs the same as a Tesla.\nThis is a significant factor for Waymo, but if it can demonstrate that its safety technology is superior to Tesla's, it may have an easier path to success.\nThe autonomous driving battles are slated to continue for the next decade or longer, making this a long-term investment. Fortunately, Alphabet is excelling right now and comes with an incredibly cheap stock price.\nWhile there has been considerable discussion about how Alphabet's legacy Google Search business will fare in the era of generative artificial intelligence (AI), the company has performed quite well overall. In Q1, Alphabet's revenue rose 12% year over year, and diluted earnings per share increased 49%. That's an impressive performance for any company, yet the stock trades for far less than most of its big-tech peers.\nAlphabet's stock can be scooped up for a mere 19.9 times trailing earnings. It has seldom traded for a level this cheap, which tells me that Alphabet is being solely valued on its legacy search business, as many of its other successful business units (like Google Cloud and Waymo) weren't around the last time that Alphabet traded this cheaply.\nGOOGL PE Ratio data by YCharts\nAs a result, I'm confident that Alphabet's stock is a great buy today. Alphabet's core business is still performing admirably and integrating generative AI technologies into the Google Search product to keep it relevant. Waymo is another exciting division within Alphabet and could emerge as a significant revenue generator for the business over the next decade.\nThere's significant upside in Alphabet's stock, and I think investors should consider buying shares while they're still relatively affordable.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $722,181!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $968,402!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,069% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 177% for the S&P 500. Don’t miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.\n*Stock Advisor returns as of June 30, 2025\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

    "title": "Want to Invest in Quantum Computing? 2 Stocks That Are Great Buys Right Now.",
    "link": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/want-invest-quantum-computing-2-stocks-are-great-buys-right-now-4",
    "ticker": "GOOGL",
    "content": "Investors always are on the lookout for the next great technology or innovation that could transform the world. They aim to invest early and benefit as the story develops and goes on to generate growth. This happened in the area of artificial intelligence (AI), as these stocks led indexes higher last year and continue to gain this year.\nToday, quantum computing may represent a similar opportunity. Like AI, quantum computing could be a game changer. It's at an even earlier stage of development, with real-world use cases a bit farther down the road. This offers investors time to get in on these stocks and share in their potential successes.\nQuantum computing is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, involving the behavior of subatomic particles to solve problems. These computers have the ability to scale exponentially, allowing them to address questions out of reach for today's classical computers.\nThe field still faces certain challenges, such as accuracy and the ability to readily scale up quantum platforms for widespread use, so investing in a pure-play quantum company today comes with some risk. But here's the good news: You can invest in quantum companies and still play it safe by getting in on the following two great buys right now.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nYou may know Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) for its ownership of a tool you use daily -- Google Search -- or its Google Cloud business. That's why this particular company makes a safe quantum computing bet. It already generates billions of dollars in revenue, thanks to those businesses, and future prospects there are strong, too.\nInnovator Alphabet also has gotten in on the quantum computing business and announced a big achievement late last year. The company presented its Willow quantum chip and said it has the ability to reduce errors when scaling up with more qubits, or the elements that store and process data. This is an important point since, as mentioned above, errors have been a challenge for quantum systems.\nAlphabet's Willow also showed its strength by quickly performing a computation that would have taken one of today's supercomputers a time that surpasses the age of the universe. Alphabet says it expects the Willow line of chips to reach the goal of showing the usefulness of quantum computing in real world problems. It's also important to note that, with Alphabet's more than $23 billion in cash, the company can support research and development in this area.\nToday, Alphabet trades for about 18x forward earnings estimates, down from more than 20x a few months ago. That looks dirt cheap for this profitable business, which also may deliver quantum computing growth.\nLike Alphabet, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) offers you the opportunity to get in on a profitable well-established tech giant and, at the same time, bet on the future of quantum computing. Microsoft has a long track record of earnings growth, thanks to its software and cloud services businesses -- but the company also continues to innovate in new areas such as AI and quantum computing.\nEarlier this year, Microsoft presented its Majorana 1 quantum chip, one that it expects to bring quantum computing to the forefront in a matter of years -- a much shorter time period than the decades spoken of by some industry experts. This chip uses a new material that allows for the production of more reliable qubits that can scale.\nOn top of this, Microsoft also launched a \"quantum ready\" program to help companies prepare to apply quantum to their businesses. The program assists customers in a variety of ways, from building practical applications to accessing quantum computers for the testing of various problems.\nMicrosoft is positioning itself to potentially become a quantum technology leader as it develops chips, but also to work closely with customers in a consulting role.\nMeanwhile, like Alphabet, Microsoft's main business continues to see revenue climb, so investors can benefit from this growth as the newer quantum story unfolds. Today, Microsoft shares trade for 32x forward earnings estimates, down from 36x just last month. This offers investors a solid buying opportunity for a tech leader that also may win in quantum computing down the road.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $722,181!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $968,402!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,069% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 177% for the S&P 500.

    "link": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/serve-robotics-fleet-expansion-gains-traction-growth-sustainable",
    "ticker": "AMZN",
    "content": "Serve Robotics Inc. SERV is entering the second half of 2025 with strong operational momentum, anchored by accelerated robot deployment and deepening city-level penetration.During its first-quarter 2025earnings call management emphasized that the company successfully built and deployed 250 new third-generation (Gen 3) robots, putting it firmly on track to meet its full-year target of 2,000 units. Serve Robotics reported a strong reception of Gen 3 models with higher cargo capacity and improved battery life.Serve Robotics is emphasizing broadening its access to drive growth. The company doubled its household reach since December and now services over 1,500 restaurants, a 50% increase quarter over quarter. Delivery volume surged more than 75% between the first and last week of the first quarter, driven by higher robot deployment and market expansion.Management anticipates a 60% to 75% sequential increase in the second quarter delivery volume, supported by continued robot rollouts and rising utilization rates across its growing footprint. The upcoming Atlanta launch further supports this expansion narrative.Serve Robotics’ self-funding strategy for its target fleet — enabled by a $198 million cash balance — gives it both capital flexibility and cost efficiency. The decision to forgo equipment financing is expected to save approximately $20 million through 2026, freeing up resources for further market penetration and technology investments.With a clear path to scale, increasing fleet utilization and positive early signs of operating leverage, Serve Robotics appears well-positioned to capitalize on a broader shift toward autonomous last-mile delivery across urban markets in the back half of 2025. The company plans to deploy 700 Gen 3 robots by the end of the third quarter of 2025 and the remainder in the fourth quarter of 2025, keeping it on track to meet its full-year deployment target.\nAmazon.com, Inc. AMZN continues to refine its fulfillment network and delivery infrastructure. While its Scout robot program was paused, Amazon's focus on robotics and automation in its warehouses and rural delivery sites underscores its broader ambitions in automated logistics. The company is also leveraging AI and custom chips (Trainium 2) to boost productivity across logistics and commerce operations.Uber Technologies, Inc. UBER is actively expanding its autonomous vehicle (AV) presence, with around 100 Waymo AVs operating in Austin and additional deployments planned in Atlanta and abroad. Management highlighted that Waymo vehicles are busier than 99% of Austin drivers in terms of daily trips. Additionally, Uber’s delivery segment continues to scale profitably, with grocery and retail delivery now contributing positive variable margins. Given its past pilot with Serve Robotics via Uber Eats, Uber remains both a competitor and a potential strategic partner in sidewalk robotics and last-mile delivery automation.While Amazon and Uber operate at much larger scales, Serve Robotics differentiates itself through its sidewalk-first, full-stack autonomous delivery focus. Its targeted expansion strategy and tech-enabled fleet efficiency give it a clear identity in the growing urban logistics race.\nShares of Serve Robotics have surged 101.5% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 12.7%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, SERV trades at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 26.62, significantly higher than the industry’s average of 19.46.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for SERV’s 2025 earnings implies a year-over-year downtick of 38.8%.

    "content": "After sell-offs in yesterday's trading, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock is rising Wednesday. The company's share price was up 4.6% as of 2 p.m. ET amid the backdrop of a 0.3% gain for the S&P 500 and a 0.7% gain for the Nasdaq Composite. The stock had been up as much as 5.4% earlier in the session.\nTesla published its second-quarter vehicle delivery figures yesterday, and the company's valuation is climbing despite a big performance drop-off. News that the U.S. has reached a trade agreement with Vietnam is supporting bullish momentum for the stock, and a much weaker than expected June jobs report from ADP also has some investors ramping up bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its meeting.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nWith the report that it published this morning, Tesla announced that it had delivered 384,000 vehicles in this year's second quarter -- a 14% year-over-year decline. Meanwhile, the average analyst estimate compiled by FactSet had called for the business to deliver 387,000 vehicles in the period.\nDespite some rallies connected to the company's robotaxi business and opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, Tesla still ranks as this year's worst-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" stock. As of this writing, the company's share price is down roughly 22% across 2025.\nEven though the company has seen a substantial valuation pullback across this year's trading, Tesla is still valued at approximately 10.5 times this year's expected sales and 168 times expected earnings. While earnings headwinds are expected to moderate somewhat, the company is also still trading at approximately 111 times next year's expected earnings.\nTesla should be able to score meaningful wins in the robotaxi business, but these wins will take time to materialize -- and the core business is struggling. While Tesla still has the potential to be a winner for investors with a very long time horizon, the significance of the challenges facing the EV business suggests that investors may be able to build positions at a better entry point.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, available when you join Stock Advisor, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n*Stock Advisor returns as of June 30, 2025\nKeith Noonan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

    "title": "Stocks Settled Mixed as Higher Bond Yields Weigh on Sentiment",
    "link": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stocks-settled-mixed-higher-bond-yields-weigh-sentiment",
    "ticker": "TSLA",
    "content": "Stock indexes on Tuesday settled mixed, with the Dow Jones Industrials posting a 4-1/2 month high.  The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 moved lower Tuesday and consolidated below Monday’s all-time highs.  Tesla closed down more than -5% to lead technology stocks lower and weigh on the overall market after President Trump threatened to withdraw subsidies from Elon Musk’s companies in response to Musk’s criticism of the Republican reconciliation bill.  The markets are also monitoring progress on trade talks ahead of President Trump’s July 9 deadline, as well as congressional wrangling over the passage of President Trump’s tax and spending bill.\nThe Senate passed the Republican reconciliation bill on Tuesday by a 51-50 vote.  The bill now goes to the House, where it will be voted on sometime this week.  Speaker Johnson said the House “will work quickly” to pass the bill by July 4.  The reconciliation bill has the debt ceiling hike that is necessary to avert a Treasury default when the Treasury runs out of borrowing authority sometime between mid-August and late September.  The dollar index fell to a 3-1/3 year low Tuesday as the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would add nearly $3.3 trillion to US budget deficits over the next decade.\nStocks remained lower Tuesday after the better-than-expected US ISM and JOLTS reports pushed bond yields higher and dampened expectations of imminent Fed rate cuts.  Also, Fed Chair Powell reiterated his wait-and-see stance on interest rates as he expects tariffs to show up in inflation data over the coming months.\nThe US June ISM manufacturing index rose +0.5 to 49.0, stronger than expectations of 48.8. Also, the June ISM prices paid sub-index rose +0.3 to 69.7, stronger than expectations of 69.5.\nUS May JOLTS job openings unexpectedly rose +374,000 to a 6-month high of 7.769 million, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of a decline to 7.300 million.\nFed Chair Powell said he expects the impacts of tariffs to show up in inflation data over the coming months, but the impact could be “higher or lower, or later or sooner than we expected.”\nBetter-than-expected manufacturing news from China is supportive of global economic growth prospects.  The China June Caixin manufacturing PMI rose +2.1 to 50.4, stronger than expectations of 49.3.\nOn the negative side for stocks is the upcoming earnings season, which begins next week. Bloomberg Intelligence data show that the consensus for Q2 earnings of S&P 500 companies is for a rise of +2.8% year-over-year, the smallest increase in two years.  Also, only six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research.\nDuring this holiday-shortened week, the markets will look for additional trade and tariff news along with progress in the passage of President Trump’s tax bill.  On Wednesday, the June ADP employment change is expected to rise by +90,000.  On Thursday, Jun nonfarm payrolls are expected to climb by +113,000, and the June employment rate is expected to tick up +0.1 to 4.3%.  Also, June average hourly earnings are expected to rise +0.3% m/m and +3.8% y/y.  In addition, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb +5,000 to 241,000, and May factory orders are expected to jump +8.1% m/m.  Finally, the Jun ISM services index is expected to climb +0.7 to 50.6.\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances at 21% for a -25 bp rate cut at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting.\nOverseas stock markets on Tuesday settled mixed.  The Euro Stoxx 50 closed down -0.39%.  China’s Shanghai Composite closed up +0.39%.  Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -1.24%.\nInterest Rates\nSpeculation that Congress is close to passing President Trump’s tax and spending bill has sparked some weakness in T-note prices.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would add nearly $3.3 trillion to US deficits over the next decade, which would boost Treasury security sales to fund the deficits.  Losses in T-notes accelerated Tuesday after the stronger-than-expected ISM and JOLTS reports were hawkish for Fed policy.\nT-note prices initially moved higher on Tuesday due to carryover support from strength in European government bonds.  T-notes were also boosted as positive trade news has bolstered hopes for smaller-than-expected tariffs, which would soften the inflation outlook.\nEuropean government bond yields on Tuesday moved lower.  The 10-year German bund yield fell -3.3 bp to 2.574%.  The 10-year UK gilt yield dropped to an 8-week low of 4.417% and finished down -3.5 bp to 4.454%.\nThe Eurozone June CPI edged up to +2.0% y/y from +1.9% y/y in May, right on expectations. The June core CPI was unchanged from May at +2.3% y/y, right on expectations.\nThe ECB May 1-year CPI inflation expectations unexpectedly eased to +2.8% from +3.1% in Apr, versus expectations of no change at +3.1%.  The May 3-year CPI expectations unexpectedly eased to +2.4% from +2.5% in Apr versus expectations of no change at +2.5%.\nThe Eurozone June manufacturing PMI was revised upward by +0.1 to 49.5 from the previously reported 49.4.\nThe German June unemployment change rose +11,000, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of +15,000.  The Jun unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.3%, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of an increase to 6.4%.\nECB Governing Council member Kazaks said, “If the euro were to significantly appreciate further, it could weigh down on inflation and exports, which could tilt the balance toward another ECB interest rate cut.”\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 6% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the July 24 policy meeting.\nUS Stock Movers\nEarnings Reports (7/2/2025)\nFranklin Covey Co (FC), UniFirst Corp/MA (UNF).\nMore news from Barchart\nThe views and opinions

    "title": "Why Shares of Tesla Are Surging Today",
    "link": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-shares-tesla-are-surging-today",
    "ticker": "TSLA",
    "content": "Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) traded 3.3% higher, as of 11:03 a.m. ET today, after trading nearly 5% higher earlier today. The move came after the electric carmaker reported deliveries for the second quarter of the year in a highly anticipated event for the company.\nTesla delivered 384,000 vehicles in the second quarter of the year, down 14% year over year. The number came in slightly below Wall Street's estimate of 387,000, according to FactSet. Tesla also reported disappointing deliveries in its seasonally weaker first quarter of the year of slightly below 337,000, down 13% year over year.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nAlthough Tesla missed Wall Street estimates, most investors expected a bad quarter of deliveries, given intra-quarter data and reports that indicated the electric carmaker's sales continued to struggle, especially in Europe and China.\nInitially, many believed that Tesla CEO Elon Musk's involvement with government affairs, including the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), had frustrated many of Tesla's core customers, leading them to trade in their vehicles or select other brands. However, competition also appears to be an issue for Tesla, as rival EV makers are releasing cheaper EVs with better capabilities.\nHowever, some think this quarter could mark a bottom for Tesla. Gene Munster, a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, wrote on X this morning that deliveries came in better than he expected, and he thinks deliveries will trend better in the back half of the year.\nTesla's second-quarter deliveries once again shows why the stock does not trade on fundamentals, and ultimately why the EV business may not matter. The company missed estimates -- and its stock is still trading higher.\nThis is nothing new for Tesla, showing why investors are not concerned about the EV business and are almost solely focused on robotaxis. But with Tesla's stock trading at a monster valuation, I continue to be on the sidelines.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, available when you join Stock Advisor, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n*Stock Advisor returns as of June 30, 2025\nBram Berkowitz has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.
