    "title": "The TSLY ETF Is an Income Monster",
    "link": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tsly-etf-income-monster",
    "ticker": "TSLA",
    "content": "Many ETFs have come onto the market recently that use various options strategies to boost income. For example, some ETFs use covered call strategies to produce yields of 10% or more for investors from relatively low-paying portfolios of stocks.\nYieldMax ETFs take this idea to the next level, using aggressive strategies to, as the name suggests, maximize yield. It's not uncommon for YieldMax ETFs to have dividend yields of 30%, 40%, or much higher in some cases.\nOne extreme example is the YieldMax Tesla Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEMKT: TSLY), which uses call option strategies on Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock to produce a high level of monthly income. In fact, based on the past 12 months of dividends, the ETF has a dividend yield of about 127%.\nOf course, if something sounds too good to be true, that's usually the case. If there was an ETF that produced a sustainable three-digit yield and was likely to do so for the foreseeable future, we'd all be scrambling to buy shares. But in this case, there are quite a few caveats and important things to know before you consider investing.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nIt might surprise you to learn that the majority of the YieldMax Tesla Option Income Strategy ETF's assets are in U.S. Treasuries. It uses these as collateral to buy and sell options on the stock, which are typically near the current share price. For example, the largest non-Treasury position in the portfolio is July 2025 call options with a $340 strike price. Some of the positions are long, some are short (meaning the ETF sold options), and there are some put options in the portfolio as well.\nThe general goal with the options positions is to create the highest stream of income relative to the risk level as possible.\nThere are two big risk factors to consider. First, and less significant, is the inconsistency of the monthly dividend payments you'll get. Over the past 12 months, the distributions from this ETF have been as high as $1.29 or as low as $0.40.\nThe bigger issue is that the stock price itself has a downward bias over time. In short, if the price of Tesla stock goes up, the ETF's options strategies severely limit the upside potential. On the other hand, if the stock falls, it can result in large losses. In fact, since the YieldMax Tesla Option Income Strategy ETF was formed in late 2022, Tesla stock has risen by 92%. Shares of this ETF have fallen by 78%, and there's even been a reverse split along the way.\nOf course, even with a modestly declining share price, an ETF like this can still be a winner. In other words, if the ETF declines by say, 30%, but pays a 100%-plus yield, it's still a great investment. But that hasn't been the case. In fact, including dividends, this ETF has generated a 26% total return for investors since its 2022 inception. That's 52 percentage points worse than if you had simply bought Tesla stock and held on to it.\nIn a nutshell, YieldMax ETFs produce the best total returns compared with simply buying the underlying stock in times when the stock is mostly flat for an extended period, without any massive price swings. And if you look at virtually any chart of Tesla's historic stock performance, you'll see that doesn't really describe its typical price action.\nThe bottom line is that if you think Tesla stock is going to be stuck in a narrow price range for a while, the YieldMax Tesla Option Income Strategy ETF could be a good way to play it. Just be aware that this and other YieldMax ETFs aren't magical income instruments and are more likely than not to produce underperforming total returns over time.\nBefore you buy stock in Tidal Trust II - YieldMax Tsla Option Income Strategy ETF, consider this:\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $692,914!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $963,866!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,050% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 179% for the S&P 500. Don’t miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.\n*Stock Advisor returns as of June 30, 2025\nMatt Frankel has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

    "title": "Tesla Q2 Deliveries Weak But Shares Rise: What's Next for Investors?",
    "link": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tesla-q2-deliveries-weak-shares-rise-whats-next-investors",
    "ticker": "TSLA",
    "content": "Electric vehicle (EV) and tech giant Tesla TSLA released its second-quarter 2025 production and delivery numbers yesterday. It produced 410,244 vehicles, down on a yearly basis. Deliveries totaled 384,122 units (373,728 Model 3/Y and 10,394 Other Models), down 13.4% year over year. The deliveries also fell short of Wall Street’s consensus mark of 390,000 units. Despite the miss, shares of Tesla were up roughly 5%, closing the session at $315.65 yesterday.\nTesla's EV business is under pressure. In the first quarter of 2025, Tesla attributed weak deliveries to production disruption associated with the Model Y changeover. However, this doesn’t hold true for the second quarter as the new Model Y has been ramped up across factories. In fact, Tesla is producing more and building up inventories, which clearly indicates a demand problem.\nAnd this demand problem is not industry-wide. While Tesla’s sales declined, General Motors’ GM EV sales more than doubled in the second quarter to 46,280 units. China’s EV behemoth BYD Co Ltd BYDDY sold 606,993 units, which increased 42.5% year over year.\nClearly, Tesla’s brand image is not the same as before. The company’s aging model lineup and CEO Elon Musk’s increasingly polarizing image have been hurting the company’s sales amid cut-throat competition.\nAmid falling EV demand, Tesla’s energy and storage business is thriving, thanks to the strong reception of its Megapack and Powerwall products. Last year, deployments soared 113% year over year, driven largely by the expansion efforts at the Mega factory in Lathrop, CA. In the second quarter of 2025, Tesla deployed 9.6 GWh of energy storage, up from 9.4 GWh in the year-ago quarter. The company expects deployments in 2025 to increase another 50% at least. Notably, this segment carries the highest margins across Tesla’s business lines. However, being a small contributor to overall revenues, its strength isn't enough to offset the ongoing weakness in the EV segment.\nTesla’s Supercharger network has also become a critical component of the company’s ecosystem. The rollout of the North American Charging Standard has bolstered Tesla’s position, allowing various automakers to access its charging network.Worldwide, Tesla has more than 70,000 Superchargers, making it the largest EV charging network globally.\nTesla is banking on self-driving technology to drive its next wave of growth. The company recently launched robotaxi services in Austin and completed a fully autonomous Model Y delivery, with no driver and no remote guidance. Musk envisions robotaxis as a game-changing revenue stream amid rising EV competition.\nBut despite the bold push, Tesla trails leaders like Waymo in the autonomous vehicle race. As with many of Tesla’s ambitious promises, investors should temper expectations. Regulatory hurdles, safety concerns and the technical complexity of full autonomy remain significant obstacles that could delay large-scale deployment and profitability.\nYear to date, shares of Tesla have declined 22%, handily underperforming peers like General Motors and BYD. While General Motors’ shares lost a modest 1%, BYD gained more than 37% during the same timeframe.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTesla's valuation remains stretched. Going by its price/sales ratio, the company is trading at a forward sales multiple of 9.64, way higher than General Motors and BYD.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThis premium is difficult to justify based on fundamentals. The market seems to be pricing in major breakthroughs in high-risk frontiers like autonomous driving and humanoid robotics—bets that are far from guaranteed to pay off.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tesla’s 2025 sales and earnings implies a year-over-year decline of 2% and 22%, respectively. The EPS estimate for Tesla has been trending southbound over the past 90 days.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTesla has been a big winner over the past decade, but its recent performance tells a different story. Delivery shortfalls, margin pressure, and increasing competition are taking a toll. Add to that Musk’s controversies with U.S. President Trump, and it's no surprise that investor sentiment is wavering.\nDownward revisions in earnings estimates and growing volatility paint a challenging near-term outlook. While Tesla still has long-term potential, particularly in areas like energy and autonomy, the risks currently outweigh the rewards.\nUntil Tesla shows real progress on both the tech and execution front, investors may be better off staying on the sidelines—or even locking in any profits if they haven’t already.\nTesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here\nEach was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in the coming year. While not all picks can be winners, previous recommendations have soared +112%, +171%, +209% and +232%.\nMost of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

    "title": "Will Tesla See a Second Consecutive Year of Delivery Decline?",
    "link": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-tesla-see-second-consecutive-year-delivery-decline",
    "ticker": "TSLA",
    "content": "Tesla TSLA is facing a growing concern that can no longer be brushed aside — weakening deliveries. After its first-ever annual delivery decline in 2024, 2025 started on a rough note. Sales have fallen across key markets, with Europe leading the downturn. Deliveries in Q1 fell 13% year over year. In Q2, deliveries fell another 13.4% to 384,122 vehicles.\nIn absolute terms, Q2 sales were only slightly better than Q1— Tesla’s worst quarter for deliveries in over two years — but fell short of both Wall Street expectations of 390,000 units as well as our forecast of 420,000 units.\nWhat makes the weak second-quarter deliveries harder to defend is the absence of any production issues. Tesla CEO Elon Musk had attributed Q1 delivery softness to factory shutdowns for the new Model Y ramp-up. However, with production now back online across plants and inventories rising sharply, it has become evident that this is a demand problem, not a supply one.\nIt should be noted that Tesla’s struggle isn’t reflective of the broader EV market — other players are growing just fine.\nGeneral Motors GM delivered 46,280 EVs in Q2, more than double its sales from the year-ago period. Last year, General Motors sold roughly 114,000 EVs in the United States, surpassing the 100,000 mark for the first time. The momentum has continued in 2025. In the first half of this year, General Motors sold 78,000 EVs and now claims a 13% share of the U.S. EV market.\nChina’s BYD Co Ltd BYDDY continues to challenge Tesla. In the fourth quarter of 2023, BYD briefly took the EV sales crown from Tesla before ending the full year just behind. The same pattern was repeated in 2024. In Q1’25, BYD delivered over 416,000 BEVs, outpacing Tesla’s 336,000. In Q2, BYD reported 606,993 BEVs sold (up 42.5% year over year), marking its third straight quarter of beating Tesla in battery EV sales.\nOther competitors like Volkswagen in Europe and Xiaomi in China are also gaining momentum, compounding pressure on Tesla’sglobal marketshare. Clearly, EV demand is still growing but Tesla sales are falling.\nTesla is now producing far more vehicles than it’s selling. Inventories, already elevated at the start of the year, rose by 50,000-60,000 vehicles in the first half of 2025. This further underscores the disconnect between supply and demand.\nAn Aging Model Lineup: Tesla hasn’t introduced a truly fresh mainstream vehicle in years. While the company continues to roll out minor refreshes, they haven’t been enough to spark renewed demand. The one new product, the Cybertruck, hasn’t caught on widely — its design is polarizing, and its appeal remains niche.\nStronger, Smarter Competition: Tesla is no longer the only game in town. Competitors are launching EVs with more advanced features, better designs and aggressive pricing. Even legacy automakers are stepping up their EV game. Tesla’s premium price point and limited product variety are starting to hurt, especially as rivals offer more choices with competitive specs and compelling designs.\nThe Musk Factor: Musk’s polarizing persona is now part of the brand. Customers are increasingly getting put off by his political commentary and erratic behavior online. With more choices available, consumers who might have previously considered Tesla are now looking elsewhere.\nTesla now faces a real chance of delivering fewer vehicles in 2025 than it did in 2024. That would mark a second straight year of declining sales, despite once aiming for 50% annual growth.\nMusk already walked back the company’s 2025 vehicle growth target from 20–30% to more modest expectations on the fourth-quarterearnings call But on the Q1 call, he didn’t even reaffirm those lowered targets. The company says it will revisit its guidance in the Q2 earnings update, but the outlook is clearly getting cloudier.\nUnless something changes drastically in the second half of 2025 — a surprise new model, major price adjustments, or demand recovery in key markets — Tesla is on track for a second consecutive year of delivery declines.\nShares of Tesla have risen around 28% over the past year against the industry’s decline of 5.6%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, TSLA trades at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 9.64, way above the industry.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSee how the Zacks Consensus Estimate for TSLA’s earnings has been revised over the past 60 days.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTesla stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here\nEach was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in the coming year.
