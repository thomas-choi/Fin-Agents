    "content": "Stocks received support from Thursday's stronger-than-expected US unemployment report, which raised hopes for continued solid US economic growth.  However, stocks were undercut as the 10-year T-note rose by +7 bp to 4.35% following the unemployment report.  Also, the chances of a Fed rate cut at the next meeting on July 29-30 fell to 5% from 23% on Wednesday.\nThe House passed the Senate's reconciliation bill on Thursday afternoon, sending it to President Trump for his signature.  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill will add nearly $3.3 trillion to US budget deficits over the next decade.  The fiscal stimulus from the bill will be a net positive for the US economy, but the higher deficit also increases the risk of an eventual debt crisis in the United States.\nThe approved reconciliation bill included a $5 trillion debt ceiling hike, thus averting the Treasury default that would have occurred in late summer or early autumn without a debt ceiling hike.  The debt ceiling hike is designed to last into 2027, which means the markets will not have to worry about that issue over the next two years.\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration's campaign against Fed Chair Powell to cut interest rates continued after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday morning in an interview on Fox Business that the Fed appears to be \"a little off\" on its interest rate setting process since the 2-year T-note yield of 3.76% at the time of his interview was below the Fed's target range for the federal funds rate of 4.25%-4.50%.  However, the 2-year T-note yield then rose to 3.88% after the stronger-than-expected US unemployment reports.\nThe Treasury yield curve remains inverted, with higher short-term rates, as the Fed continues to battle the high post-COVID inflation environment and the new inflation pressures from President Trump's tariffs.  Any artificial attempt to cut interest rates below ideal levels could lead to severe inflationary pressures and spark an eventual upward spike in short-term interest rates, potentially triggering a recession.\nMr. Bessent also said the administration hopes to fill two empty Fed seats next year, meaning that the administration is hoping Jerome Powell will leave the Fed altogether after stepping down as Fed Chair in May 2026, even though his separate term as a Fed Governor doesn't end until January 2028.\nTrade talks are in focus ahead of the July 9 deadline for implementing reciprocal tariffs. The EU aims to reach an agreement in principle with the US by the July 9 deadline, according to comments made Thursday by EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.  She said there is no way a full trade agreement could be reached by July 9.  In other trade deal news, President Trump on Wednesday said that the US had reached a trade agreement with Vietnam.  President Trump said on Tuesday that a trade deal with Japan is unlikely, so the country will most likely pay a tariff of 30%, 35%, or \"whatever the number is that we determine.\"\nThursday's June non-farm payroll report of +147,000 was stronger than expectations of +106,000.  The payroll report came as a bit of a surprise, given that the markets had been braced for a weak report following Wednesday's news of a -33,000 drop in the US June ADP employment report, which marked the first decline in 2.25 years. The stronger-than-expected payroll increase in June was driven by a rise in employment in state and local governments, including public education.  By contrast, private payrolls rose just +74,000, suggesting labor market weakness outside the state and local governments.  June manufacturing payrolls fell -7,000, matching May's decline. There was a net upward revision of +16,000 in April-May payrolls.\nThe June US unemployment rate fell by -0.1 point to 4.1%, also indicating a stronger labor market than expectations for a +0.1 point rise to 4.3%.  The June unemployment rate of 4.1% is up from the 8-decade low of 3.4% posted in April 2023.\nIn some positive news for the inflation outlook, June average hourly earnings rose +0.2% m/m and +3.7%, weaker than expectations of +0.3% m/m and +3.8% and down from May's +0.4% m/m and +3.9% y/y.\nInitial unemployment claims fell by -4,000 to 233,000, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of 241,000.  Continuing claims were unchanged at 1.964 million, showing a slightly weaker labor market than expectations of 1.962 million.\nThe May US trade deficit of -$71.5 billion was slightly larger than expectations of -$71.0 billion, and was up from April's revised -$60.3 billion deficit.  May exports fell -4.0% m/m.  May imports fell -0.1% m/m, adding to April's -16.3% plunge.\nThe June ISM US Services Index rose by +0.9 to 50.8 from 49.9 in May, stronger than expectations for a +0.7 point rise to 50.6.  The June ISM services prices paid index fell by -1.2 points to 67.5 from 68.7 in May, weaker than expectations for a +0.2 point increase to 68.9.\nThe final-June S&P US services PMI was revised slightly lower by -0.2 points to 52.9 from the preliminary report of 53.1, weaker than expectations for an unrevised report of 53.1.  The final-June S&P US Composite PMI was revised slightly higher by +0.1 point to 52.9 from 52.8, stronger than expectations for an unrevised report of 52.8.\nMay US factory orders rose +8.2% m/m, in line with market expectations and represented a rebound after May's revised decline of -3.9%.  May US factory orders ex-transportation rose by +0.2% m/m, in line with market expectations.\nOn the negative side for stocks is the upcoming earnings season, which begins next week.  Bloomberg Intelligence data show that the consensus for Q2 earnings of S&P 500 companies is for a rise of +2.8% year-over-year, the smallest increase in two years.  Also, only six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research.\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances at 5% for a -25 bp rate cut at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting.\nOverseas stock markets on Thursday closed higher.   The Euro Stoxx 50 closed up +0.46%.  China's Shanghai Composite closed up +0.18%.  Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.06%.\nInterest Rates\nIn a bearish factor for T-notes, Atlanta Fed President Bostic on

    "title": "Better AI Stock for 2H25: NVIDIA or Palantir? ",
    "link": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-ai-stock-2h25-nvidia-or-palantir",
    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "content": "Shares of Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR, which sells a well-liked artificial intelligence (AI)-powered software platform, have surged 74.7% so far this year, outperforming the leading AI chip maker, NVIDIA Corporation’s NVDA 17.1% gain. Can Palantir keep outperforming NVIDIA in the second half, and is it the better AI stock for your portfolio?\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe surge in demand for NVIDIA’s state-of-the-art new-generation Blackwell chips helped the company’s sales grow 69% year over year to $44.1 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended on April 27. NVIDIA overcame supply-chain bottlenecks and delivered Blackwell AI servers to customers such as Microsoft Corporation MSFT.\nStrong demand for AI chips will boost NVIDIA’s sales, supported by increased developer adoption of the CUDA platform. The AI revolution in self-driving cars and autonomous robots also benefits NVIDIA. As major cloud computing companies like Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL purchase NVIDIA’s graphics processing units (GPUs), in which the company holds a large share, the company is likely to see further growth.\nPresident Trump’s tariffs and export restrictions on AI chips to China may impact NVIDIA’s sales, but the company is adjusting its hardware specifications to resume sales there. Even without China, NVIDIA is positioned to benefit from the worldwide demand for AI capabilities.\nA rise in both commercial and government contracts helped Palantir increase its revenues in the first quarter. Commercial revenues increased 71% year over year (YoY) to $255 million, while government revenues rose 45% YoY to $373 million.\nPalantir’s sales growth has contributed to strong financial results, with net income reaching $217.7 million in the first quarter, more than doubling last year’s $106.1 million. Palantir’s adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $370 million, up 42% YoY. Additionally, the remaining performance obligations of $1.9 billion and an estimated total addressable market of over $1 trillion in the next decade indicate Palantir’s continued strength.\nPalantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), capable of automating tasks beyond human reach, drove its revenue growth. The company’s new AI products, like Warp Speed, which uses AI to improve U.S. manufacturing efficiency, are also expected to boost revenues.\nMeanwhile, Palantir shareholders are excited about President Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill”. This is because Palantir is a key player in developing the Golden Dome missile defense system, included in the bill.  Moreover, the ongoing geopolitical tensions and the AI arms race could further benefit Palantir.\nPalantir’s AIP and other AI products are expected to see heightened commercial success in the near term, while strong demand for new Blackwell GPUs will boost NVIDIA’s profit margins. However, the only issue with investing in Palantir is its lofty valuations.\nPer the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, Palantir trades at 226.62 times forward earnings, while NVIDIA’s forward earnings multiple is 37.07. So, an economic downturn may quickly lower Palantir’s share price, unlike NVIDIA’s.\nP/E – F1                         PALANTIR TECH (PLTR) vs. NVIDIA CORP (NVDA)\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTherefore, it’s safe to conclude that NVIDIA is a better stock than Palantir in the second half. Palantir stock only suits aggressive investors. But those seeking stable returns should consider NVIDIA. At the moment, both stocks possess a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nEach was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in the coming year. While not all picks can be winners, previous recommendations have soared +112%, +171%, +209% and +232%.\nMost of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "content": "Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR has soared 75% year to date, far outpacing the broader industry’s 15% average gain and the Zacks S&P 500 composite’s modest 5% advance. The question now facing investors: Does PLTR still offer an attractive entry point, or is it smarter to wait for a pullback?\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAt the heart of Palantir’s recent breakout is its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which is rapidly evolving into its primary growth engine. In the first quarter of 2025, U.S. commercial revenues surged 71% year over year and climbed 19% sequentially, propelling the segment past the $1 billion annual run rate milestone for the first time. Total contract value in this business soared 239% YoY, while the number of deals worth over $1 million more than doubled compared to the prior year.\nPalantir’s AIP bootcamps — intensive onboarding and implementation sessions — have been instrumental in accelerating adoption. These programs equip enterprise clients to deploy production-ready AI solutions in record time, drastically reducing the time-to-value and demonstrating the platform’s intuitive interface and scalability.\nAt its core, AIP enables organizations to embed autonomous AI agents across workflows, shrinking decision timelines and scaling productivity by multiples, not mere percentages. While competitors focus on AI model development, PLTR is winning on deployment, offering turnkey, enterprise-ready solutions that drive real results from day one. The U.S. commercial business has now become Palantir’s most dynamic revenue driver, and AIP is the key accelerant.\nTech giants like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet’s Google GOOGL, and Salesforce CRM are also ramping up their AI initiatives. Microsoft continues to expand its Copilot integrations across Office and Azure while strengthening AI governance. Google enhances Workspace and Vertex AI, with a growing emphasis on security and compliance. Meanwhile, Salesforce is layering AI across its CRM ecosystem through Einstein Copilot and Data Cloud, pushing toward deeply personalized user experiences.\nDespite this intensifying competition from Microsoft, Google, and Salesforce, Palantir stands apart. Its strength lies in serving mission-critical sectors, such as defense, intelligence, and healthcare, where security, trust, and performance are non-negotiable. While Salesforce, Microsoft, and Google excel in customer-facing tools and broad AI frameworks, Palantir delivers deeply embedded, operational AI that drives high-stakes decision-making. That is a competitive edge that we believe its peers have yet to match.\nPalantir’s financial foundation remains robust. As of March 31, 2025, the company held $5.4 billion in cash and reported zero debt, giving it the flexibility to reinvest aggressively in growth without relying on external capital.\nRevenue momentum also remains strong. First-quarter sales climbed 39.3% year over year. The company closed 139 deals worth at least $1 million, including 51 over $5 million and 31 surpassing the $10 million mark, a testament to rising enterprise demand and deeper platform penetration.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 EPS stands at 14 cents, indicating a 55.6% jump from the prior year. Full-year earnings are forecasted to grow 41.5% in 2025, followed by 24% growth in 2026. Sales projections are similarly upbeat, with expected revenue growth of 38% in the second quarter, and full-year top-line expansion of 37% in 2025 and 28% in 2026.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPLTR’s valuation remains a meaningful overhang. Palantir trades at a forward P/E of 202, five times the industry average of 40. This lofty multiple bakes in extremely high expectations around future AI monetization and the strength of government contracts.\nSuch an aggressive valuation leaves little room for error. Any misstep in execution or downward earnings revision could trigger outsized volatility, underscoring the need for discipline and patience among prospective buyers.\nPalantir is proving its capability as a serious contender in enterprise AI, backed by a compelling product, strong financials, and growing commercial traction. But the current valuation suggests the optimism is already largely priced in.\nLong-term investors should continue holding their positions. However, new entrants may benefit from exercising caution. A more favorable entry point could emerge following a pullback or valuation reset, especially if near-term sentiment cools.\nPLTR currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

    "content": "Fastly FSLY shares have declined 26.4% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Internet Software industry’s appreciation of 14.8% and the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector's return of 5.7%.The decline reflects macroeconomic uncertainty and near-term softness in enterprise IT spending, even as Fastly continues to execute on its strategic priorities.However, we believe this dip presents an attractive entry point for investors seeking exposure to a differentiated edge cloud platform. Fastly’s strong partner ecosystem, expanding product portfolio and consistent enterprise traction provide visibility into sustained execution. The recent dip offers a chance to accumulate the stock at a more reasonable price as the company scales across content delivery, security and AI-driven workloads.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFastly continues to build on its platform strengths by introducing capabilities that address modern infrastructure challenges across security, observability and developer control. While content delivery remains core to its business, Fastly is evolving into a full-stack edge cloud platform, supported by continued product enhancements.In the first quarter of 2025, Fastly introduced Client-Side Protection, a browser-based security feature that defends against unauthorized script modifications. The solution supports PCI-DSS compliance and helps protect sensitive data in high-risk, customer-facing applications. Fastly has expanded its Bot Management capabilities with Dynamic Challenges, Advanced Client-Side Detection and Compromised Credential Checking. These features allow enterprises to reduce fraud, secure login flows and limit CAPTCHA fatigue, which are key concerns for large-scale digital platforms.Fastly added HTTP Cache API support for programmatic cache control, allowing faster content updates and lower origin traffic in dynamic environments thereby improving developer experience. It released Custom and Media Shield dashboards within its observability suite, enabling better monitoring of performance-intensive, media-driven workloads.These innovations are driving measurable adoption. Packaging deals more than doubled year over year, while new logo wins rose over 80% in the reported quarter. As customers increasingly deploy across product lines, Fastly is positioned to benefit from stronger attach rates and deeper enterprise relationships.\nFastly is benefiting from a rich partner baseincluding Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL and Palo Alto Networks PANW, among others. Through Alphabet’s Google Cloud Marketplace, enterprises can access Fastly’s platform via unified billing and faster provisioning, making adoption smoother in multi-cloud environments. On Microsoft’s Azure platform, Fastly supports hybrid workloads with optimized delivery and low-latency performance, helping developers build responsive applications at the edge. Meanwhile, compatibility with Palo Alto Networks enhances Fastly’s positioning in security-led use cases, where protection of APIs and application traffic is critical.Fastly closed the first quarter of 2025 with 577 enterprise customers, who contributed 93% of total revenue. Remaining performance obligations rose 33.5% year over year to $303 million, signalling stronger adoption across Fastly’s product portfolio and continued traction within its growing customer base.\nFastly shares appear attractively valued compared with the industry. The stock is currently trading at a forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) of 1.63X, significantly lower than the industry’s 5.76X.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFastly expects revenues between $143 million and $147 million for the second quarter of 2025, indicating sequential growth from the March quarter. The company expects a non-GAAP operating loss between $8 million and $4 million, with a non-GAAP net loss per share in the range of 8 cents to 4 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 revenues is pegged at $145.07 million, indicating 9.59% year-over-year growth.\nFastly, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Fastly, Inc. Quote\nThe consensus estimate for the second quarter loss is pegged at 5 cents per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. This implies an improvement of 28.57% from the year-ago quarter.\nFastly’s differentiated edge cloud platform, expanding partner ecosystem and product innovations in areas like security, observability and developer control continue to support enterprise traction. Strength in packaging and new logo deals, alongside improving customer metrics and rising performance obligations, reflects growing platform adoption. The company’s stable second-quarter outlook and disciplined execution offer added visibility. At current levels, the stock’s attractive valuation, combined with positive estimate trends, supports the case for accumulation. Fastly with Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A offers a strong investment opportunity, per the Zacks Proprietary methodology. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nEach was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in the coming year. While not all picks can be winners, previous recommendations have soared +112%, +171%, +209% and +232%.\nMost of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "content": "Okta OKTA is aiming to deliver a 15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in revenues, with projections rising from $1.86 billion in fiscal 2023 to around $2.85-2.86 billion by fiscal 2026. While near-term guidance remains cautious at 9-10% year-over-year growth, the company’s first-quarter 2026 performance and innovative product portfolio indicate strong underlying momentum.For first-quarter fiscal 2026, Okta reported an 11.5% revenue increase to $688 million, and particularly, its remaining performance obligations (RPO) rose 21% year over year, reflecting a solid pipeline of committed future business.A key catalyst is Okta’s expanding identity platform. High-growth offerings like Identity Governance, Privileged Access and Device Access are strengthening its trusted security services and deepening its relevance across enterprise IT. To better serve distinct customer segments, the company has also separated its sales teams for Workforce Identity and Customer Identity (Auth0), a move expected to sharpen focus and improve sales execution.Okta continues to gain strong traction among large enterprises through strategic partnerships like AWS. The number of customers generating more than $1 million in annual contract value (ACV) grew 20% year over year.Despite macroeconomic headwinds, Okta’s strong execution, growing enterprise base and growing relevance in cloud security offer a clear runway to achieve its goal.\nMicrosoft MSFT poses a strong challenge to Okta through Entra ID, its seamlessly integrated IAM platform across Microsoft 365, Azure and Windows. Entra now supports over 900 million monthly active users, while Microsoft’s broader security ecosystem supports 1.4 million customers. With widespread adoption of Databricks and Snowflake on Azure, and Microsoft 365’s dominance in productivity software, Microsoft reinforces its leadership in identity, cloud security and scalable IaaS/PaaS solutions, making it a cornerstone of modern enterprise infrastructure.CyberArk Software CYBR, a privileged access management leader, stands out against Okta with its advanced identity security platform and strong profitability. Strategic acquisitions such as Venafi and Zilla Security have enhanced its capabilities, increasing threat detection and response. By proactively securing privileged access and streamlining security infrastructure, CyberArk helps organizations prevent breaches while lowering total cost of ownership, offering a compelling edge in enterprise cybersecurity and identity governance.\nShares of Okta have gained 24.5% year to date compared with the Zacks Security industry’s return of 22%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nOkta currently trades at a premium with a forward Price/Cash Flow ratio of 23.11, higher than the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s 20.02X. OKTA has a Value Score of D.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at 84 cents per share, up by 5 cents over the past 60 days, indicating 16.67% year-over-year growth.The consensus mark for fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $3.28 per share, which increased 2.8% over the past 60 days. The earnings figure suggests 16.73% growth over the figure reported in fiscal 2025.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nOKTA stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

    "link": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nuscale-power-stock-96-year-date-smr-tech-catalyst",
    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "content": "NuScale Power SMR shares have surged 96.4% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 5.7% and the Zacks Electronics- Power Generation industry’s rise of 96.1%.The outperformance can be attributed to the advancements in Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology. The company’s expanding partner base, which includes tech giants and financial institutions, positions SMR as a key player in the future of sustainable, carbon-free energy.The company is also benefiting from the high demand for electricity and clean energy, as well as the increasing need for AI-powered data centers, which serve as a major driving factor.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNuScale Power is pioneering advanced solutions to address global energy and water challenges through its advanced small modular reactor technology.Building on this momentum, in June, NuScale Power announced research programs focused on integrating clean water production and hydrogen generation using its advanced SMR technology. A single NuScale Power Module can produce 150 million gallons of clean water daily, while 12 modules can power 400,000 homes and supply desalinated water to 2.3 million people. NuScale Power’s novel hydro-thermal hydrogen production method utilizes brine waste, eliminating the need for electrolysis and reducing both carbon emissions and resource usage.\nNuScale Power is gaining strong momentum across various sectors, particularly as energy demand continues to rise. The increasing energy demand, driven by sectors like data centers, which require continuous, reliable, and carbon-free energy, has been a major growth driver.Data centers are expected to triple their energy use over the next three years, accounting for 12% of U.S. electricity consumption by 2028. This growth trend presents a significant opportunity for NuScale Power, as its SMR technology offers consistent, carbon-free energy that can meet the increasing demands of hyperscale data centers.\nNuScale Power continues to attract strong interest from major technology companies and infrastructure capital. Companies like Meta Platforms, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet and Oracle ORCL have made substantial commitments to using nuclear energy, including SMR technology, to meet their sustainability goals, which positively impacts NuScale Power’s market positioning.Microsoft’s commitment to nuclear energy has further validated the demand for SMR technology in powering data centers and heavy industries. Microsoft is also planning an $80 billion investment in fiscal 2025 to build AI-enabled data centers, contributing to the projected six-fold increase in U.S. power demand over the next 20 years.Companies like Google and Oracle are also showing interest in using SMR technology for large-scale data centers, reinforcing the growing trend toward nuclear solutions for energy-intensive tech operations. As Alphabet, META Platforms, Microsoft, and Oracle align their energy strategies with sustainable nuclear options, the demand for SMR technology continues to gain momentum, positioning NuScale Power at the forefront of this emerging energy market.\nDespite NuScale Power’s advancements in SMR technology and expanding partner base, the company is facing stiff competition in the SMR sector of the nuclear energy industry from companies like Oklo OKLO and BWX Technologies.In May 2025, OKLO signed a memorandum of understanding with Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power to collaborate on the development and global deployment of its advanced nuclear technology. This partnership aims to jointly advance the design and verification of Oklo’s Aurora powerhouse and cooperate on early project development efforts.\nFor 2025, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for loss is pegged at 42 cents per share, which has remained unchanged over the past 30 days. SMR reported earnings of 42 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.\nNuScale Power Corporation price-consensus-chart | NuScale Power Corporation Quote\nNuScale Power shares are currently overvalued, as suggested by its Value Score of F.In terms of the forward 12-month price/sales (P/S), SMR is trading at 95.22X, significantly higher than its median of 33.33X and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s 6.51X.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNuScale Power’s advancements in SMR technology, along with its growing partnerships with tech giants and financial institutions, position it as a key player in the future of sustainable, carbon-free energy.However, despite these innovations and collaborations, the company faces challenges in the highly competitive energy market, which includes the growing presence of renewable energy sources and regulatory hurdles. These factors could affect NuScale Power’s market positioning, despite its technological edge. SMR’s stretched valuation is also a concern.NuScale Power currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which implies that investors should wait for a more favorable entry point to accumulate the stock.

    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "content": "Adobe ADBE reported second-quarter fiscal 2025 operating cash flow of $2.19 billion, up 13% year over year. Despite a sequential decline of 15% Adobe’s bright prospects, driven by an expanding AI portfolio, are noteworthy.Several factors are driving Adobe’s cash flow growth. Its core Digital Media segment, led by Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, continues to deliver strong recurring revenues. Subscription models provide consistent income, while growing adoption of AI-driven features, such as Firefly, Acrobat AI Assistant and Express, expands customer engagement and product stickiness. Adobe benefits from a rising Remaining Performance Obligations of $19.69 billion, with 67% expected to be recognized within a year, offering visibility into future cash inflows.The question now is whether Adobe can maintain this momentum. With $5.71 billion in cash and short-term investments as of May 30, 2025, Adobe is well-positioned to continue investing in product innovation, AI integration and strategic acquisitions. Strong cash reserves also give Adobe flexibility to navigate economic headwinds while continuing share repurchases, evidenced by the 8.6 million shares repurchased in the second quarter alone, and currently have $10.90 billion remaining as part of its $25 billion authorization.    For investors, these indicators reinforce confidence in Adobe’s ability to deliver long-term value. As the company evolves from a creative software leader to a broader digital experience and AI powerhouse, its financial strength is laying the foundation for enduring momentum.\nMicrosoft MSFT competes with Adobe through its robust cloud and productivity suites, particularly Azure and Microsoft 365 Copilot, which are integrated with creative tools and workflow automation. Unlike Adobe’s specialized product lineup, Microsoft’s scale across cloud and AI ecosystems offers seamless cross-platform selling opportunities. In third-quarter fiscal 2025, Microsoft generated roughly $37 billion, up 16% year over year, driven by strong cloud billings and collections.Salesforce CRM directly challenges Adobe in the digital marketing and experience space with Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Service Cloud and Gen AI-powered customer tools. While Adobe excels in creative workflows, Salesforce leads in CRM-based automation and enterprise reach. In first-quarter fiscal 2026, Salesforce reported $6.5 billion in operating cash flow, up 4% year over year, underscoring the company’s strength in monetizing its platform and expanding its digital experience footprint.\nAdobe shares have declined 14.9% year to date, while the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector has returned 5.7% and the Computer-Software industry has risen 14.6%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAdobe stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 6.7X compared with the Computer and Technology sector’s 6.51X.

The consensus mark for earnings estimates for fiscal 2025 and 2026 has been revised upward by 1.2% and 1.5%, respectively, over the past 30 days.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAdobe currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
