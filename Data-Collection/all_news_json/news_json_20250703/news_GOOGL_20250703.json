    "content": "Nvidia is currently the clear leader in AI infrastructure.\nHowever, Alphabet may be a surprise contender to become its biggest competitor.\nThe company started renting out its TPU chips earlier this year, and OpenAI has begun testing them.\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has long been the dominant player in the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure market. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the main chips used to power AI workloads, while its CUDA software platform has helped create a wide moat. However, if there is a surprise company that can challenge Nvidia, it's Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG).\nToday, most companies running AI workloads use Nvidia's chips. However, Alphabet has turned to its own in-house chips called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to help reduce costs and improve performance.\nAlphabet uses TPUs internally for AI workloads, but it also rents the chips to outside developers. It was initially reported that OpenAI was renting Alphabet's TPUs to help run ChatGPT, although the company has since said it is just testing the chips and not looking to deploy them at scale at this time. Nonetheless, this is a big development. OpenAI is one of Nvidia's largest customers and a Google rival, and the fact that it is looking at Alphabet's TPUs demonstrate the capabilities and cost advantages its chips can provide.\nWhat makes TPUs so compelling is that they are specifically designed for Google's infrastructure, giving them advantages in latency, scalability, and cost. As the market starts to shift toward AI inference, Alphabet's TPUs could become a better choice than GPUs. Meanwhile, Alphabet recently introduced a TPU specifically designed for inference called Ironwood in April.\nAlphabet's vertical integration also gives it a potential edge. It's one of the few companies that can offer custom AI chips, a top-tier cloud-computing platform, and a full software platform. Nvidia may dominate GPUs, but it doesn't offer a cloud-computing platform. This is something that Alphabet can take advantage of, especially with inference where pricing and latency are more important considerations.\nThe market backdrop is also favorable for Alphabet. Spending on AI infrastructure is expected to remain strong, with Nvidia projecting global data center capital expenditures (capex) to surpass $1 trillion by 2028. At the same time, many experts are predicting that inference will become a much larger market than model training. AI inference is much less technically challenging than AI training, which helps negate some of Nvidia's CUDA advantage. This could lead to more companies looking for chips that can provide cheaper costs per inference compared to GPUs.\nThat said, it isn't likely that Alphabet is going to ever to take a huge amount of share away from Nvidia. However, even small share gains in inference workloads could be a big boost for Google Cloud. That's because TPU adoption would directly feed into Google Cloud usage as well. Google Cloud has been growing revenue quickly, with revenue climbing 28% year over year last quarter to $12.3 billion. More importantly, segment profitability has hit an inflection point, with segment operating income soaring 142% to $2.2 billion.\nTPUs help boost Google Cloud's profits, not just by bringing in new customers but by lowering costs as well. And it doesn't stop just with chips. Alphabet has also developed all-optical switches that significantly reduce the power consumption and cost of TPUs. This gives the company strong operating leverage that the market currently isn't appreciating.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nRight now, Alphabet trades at a discount to other AI leaders, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18 times based on current year analyst estimates. Investors still largely view it as a search company whose core business could be disrupted by AI, while ignoring the big advantages in search it has with its distribution and global ad network reach.\nThey also underestimate the company's strong AI offerings. Gemini is consistently ranked as one of the top AI models in independent tests, and its app has seen downloads surge. It also has the best text-to-video generator on the market with Veo 3 and is incorporating AI features into its search offering. And let's not forget the company also owns the world's most-viewed streaming platform in YouTube, and its Waymo robotaxi business has been seeing strong momentum.\nAlphabet's TPUs are another big potential growth driver. Nvidia's lead is massive, but if Alphabet can land a major customer like OpenAI and expand TPU adoption, it has a chance to become one of Nvidia's biggest competitors in inference in the future. And if that happens, Alphabet's stock should move meaningfully higher.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $692,914!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $963,866!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,049% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 179% for the S&P 500.

    "ticker": "GOOGL",
    "content": "June and the second quarter wrapped up this week, with no shortage of trade updates and record highs to satisfy trader's risk appetite. A rotation out of tech dampened sentiment midweek, but not before the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) signed off Monday with its best quarter in five years, and alongside the S&P 500 Index (SPX), scored fresh record highs on Tuesday.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) enjoyed a 400-point pop and fourth-straight win, as traders eyed President Donald  Trump's \"big, beautiful bill,\" which cleared the Senate. A disappointing ADP jobs report kept optimism in check, but strong nonfarm payrolls data as well as a narrower-than-expected drop in June unemployment boosted stocks again. All three indexes are headed for healthy weekly wins, with the market closing at 1 p.m. E.T. on Thursday and closed on Friday for Independence Day.\nA settlement with the Department of Justice (DoJ) boosted artificial intelligence (AI) names Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Juniper Networks (JNPR), while Oracle (ORCL) stock enjoyed a bull note. AI names Meta Platforms (META) and BigBear.ai (BBAI) were also in focus, with the former breaking records. Trump and Tesla's (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk continued to spar, with the equity subsequently dragging the Nasdaq from its Tuesday record. Meanwhile, quantum computing giant Rigetti Computing (RGTI) reaped the benefits of more analyst praise.\nA new month means it is now time to look at seasonality trends. At least six energy names appeared on a list of the worst stocks to own in July, historically, with Coterra Energy (CTRA) among them. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), on the other hand, is among the best stocks to own this month, despite its 5.7% year-to-date deficit. Nvidia (NVDA) stock appeared on a list of outperformers for the third quarter, after scoring a record high on Friday. What's more, third-quarter seasonality for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has seen a range of outperforming sectors.\nInvestors will return from the long holiday weekend to the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) meeting minutes for May, as well as consumer credit data. The earnings docket remains quiet, though Conagra (CAG), Delta Air Lines (DAL), and Levi Strauss (LEVI) will report quarterly results. With the third quarter now underway, Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White uncovered a list of stocks to target during the second half of the year. Meanwhile, Senior Market Strategist Matthew Timpane flagged a key SPX level that should warrant investor caution.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

    "title": "August 22nd Options Now Available For Alphabet (GOOGL)",
    "link": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/august-22nd-options-now-available-alphabet-googl",
    "ticker": "GOOGL",
    "content": "The put contract at the $175.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.65.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $175.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $168.35 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of GOOGL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $178.37/share today.\nBecause the $175.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.80% return on the cash commitment, or 27.74% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alphabet Inc, and highlighting in green where the $175.00 strike is located relative to that history:\nTurning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $180.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.95.  If an investor was to purchase shares of GOOGL stock at the current price level of $178.37/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $180.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.37% if the stock gets called away at the August 22nd expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if GOOGL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alphabet Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing GOOGL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $180.00 strike highlighted in red:\nConsidering the fact that the $180.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%.  On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.46% boost of extra return to the investor, or 32.54% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 34%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 35%.\nMeanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $178.37) to be 32%.
