The company is benefiting from strong growth in Services revenues. It now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth. Apple expects the June quarter’s (third-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to grow low to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. Introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia is helping Apple sell more of its devices including iPhone. However, weakness in iPhone sales, particularly in China, is a concern. Increasing regulatory headwinds and tariffs are potentially problematic for investors.(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)Oracle’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+38.9% vs. +15.4%). The company reported solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results, wherein earnings and revenues beat estimates. Revenues were driven by continued momentum from its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure business, including from winning cloud-computing contracts from AI-focused startups. ORCL’s continued investment in cloud infrastructure positions it well for sustained growth in the dynamic software industry. Its partnership with Amazon for Oracle Database@AWS and general availability of Oracle Database@Google bodes well. Oracle’s Gen 2 Cloud is driving artificial intelligence clientele. Its share buybacks and dividend policy are noteworthy. However, higher spending on product enhancements, toward the cloud platform amid increasing competition in the cloud domain is likely to limit margin expansion.(You can read the full research report on Oracle here >>>)Shares of Goldman Sachs have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry over the past year (+56.2% vs. +41.5%). The company cleared the 2025 Fed stress test and plans to raise its dividends. Its refocus on the core strengths of investment banking (IB) and trading businesses through restructuring initiatives will boost its presence in the overseas markets.Goldman Sachs’ decent cash levels and solid credit profile will support capital distribution activities. Further, its earnings surpassed the estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. Moreover, its strategic acquisitions and expansion in the private equity credit line will help diversify the fee-revenue base. Its earnings beat estimates in the trailing four quarters.However, given the current geopolitical concerns, the company’s high dependence on overseas revenues is worrisome. Rising expenses may limit its bottom-line growth.(You can read the full research report on Goldman Sachs here >>>)Precipio’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical Info Systems industry over the past year (+125.9% vs. +37.3%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $17.08 million has seen its pathology division continue to scale profitably, surpassing $1.3 million per month revenue for two straight quarters and expanding gross margins to 42%, enabling self-funded R&D. MolDx approval for NGS testing unlocks new Medicare reimbursements, boosting cash flow.The Products division, although flat, is poised for growth with new panels, margin gains (51% vs. 37%), and easing FDA Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) headwinds. Operational cash use declined to $44,000 in first-quarter 2025, improving EBITDA and enabling dilution-free growth. Yet liquidity remains fragile, onboarding delays persist, and distributor dependence compresses margins. With a limited salesforce, regulatory exposure and customer concentration risks, execution and funding remain critical. Precipio’s valuation suggests a potential value upside if scalability improves.(You can read the full research report on Precipio here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Costco Wholesale Corp.

    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "content": "Stock indexes settled mostly higher on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 posting a new all-time high.  Strength in semiconductor makers on Wednesday led the broader market higher.  Also, Wednesday's +3% rally in WTI crude oil prices underpinned energy producers.  Stocks added to their gains after President Trump announced that the US had reached a trade deal with Vietnam.\nHowever, gains in the broader market were limited by concern that the US labor market is weakening, following the June ADP employment report, which showed that employment at US companies unexpectedly declined for the first time in more than two years.  Weakness in health insurance stocks also weighed on the overall market, led by a -40% plunge in Centene after it withdrew its 2025 guidance due to insurance market trends that differed from its initial assumptions.\nThe markets are awaiting a House vote on the Senate version of President Trump's tax and spending bill.  Also, trade talks are in focus ahead of the July 9 deadline for reciprocal tariff implementation.  Late Tuesday, President Trump said a trade deal with Japan is unlikely, so the country will most likely pay a tariff of 30%, 35%, or \"whatever the number is that we determine.\"\nOn Tuesday, the Senate passed the Republican reconciliation bill by a 51-50 vote.  The bill is currently being considered by the House, where a vote is expected sometime this week.  Speaker Johnson said the House \"will work quickly\" to try to pass the bill by July 4.  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would add nearly $3.3 trillion to US budget deficits over the next decade.  The reconciliation bill has the debt ceiling hike that is necessary to avert a Treasury default when the Treasury runs out of borrowing authority on the so-called “X-date,” which falls sometime between mid-August and late September.\nUS MBA mortgage applications rose +2.7% in the week ended June 27, with the purchase mortgage sub-index up +0.1% and the refinancing mortgage sub-index up +6.5%.  The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell -9 bp to 6.79% from 6.88% in the prior week.\nUS June ADP employment unexpectedly fell -33,000, weaker than expectations of a +98,000 increase and the first decline in 2-1/4 years.\nRichmond Fed President Barkin said the numbers on the US economy remain solid and there's no urgency to change monetary policy at the moment.\nOn the negative side for stocks is the upcoming earnings season, which begins next week.  Bloomberg Intelligence data show that the consensus for Q2 earnings of S&P 500 companies is for a rise of +2.8% year-over-year, the smallest increase in two years.  Also, only six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research.\nDuring this holiday-shortened week, the markets will look for additional trade and tariff news along with progress in the possible passage of President Trump's tax bill.  On Thursday, June nonfarm payrolls are expected to climb by +106,000, and the June employment rate is expected to tick up +0.1 to 4.3%.  Also, June average hourly earnings are expected to rise +0.3% m/m and +3.8% y/y.  In addition, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb +5,000 to 241,000, and May factory orders are expected to jump +8.1% m/m.  Finally, the June ISM services index is expected to climb +0.7 to 50.6.\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances at 23% for a -25 bp rate cut at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting.\nOverseas stock markets on Wednesday settled mixed.  The Euro Stoxx 50 closed up +0.69%.  China's Shanghai Composite closed down -0.09%.  Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.56%.\nInterest Rates\nT-notes were under pressure on Wednesday due to carryover weakness in European government bonds.  Also, speculation that Congress is close to passing President Trump's tax and spending bill sparked some weakness in T-note prices.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would add nearly $3.3 trillion to US deficits over the next decade, which would boost Treasury security sales to fund the deficits.  Rising inflation expectations also undercut T-note prices, as the 10-year breakeven inflation expectations rate rose to a one-week high Wednesday of 2.323%.  Losses in T-notes were limited after the June ADP employment report unexpectedly declined for the first time in more than two years, a dovish factor for Fed policy.\nEuropean government bond yields on Wednesday moved higher.  The 10-year German bund yield jumped to a 1-1/2 month high of 2.675% and finished up +9.0 bp to 2.664%.  The 10-year UK gilt yield rose to a 3-week high of 4.633% and finished up +15.8 bp to 4.612%.\nThe Eurozone May unemployment rate unexpectedly rose +0.1 to 6.3%, showing a weaker labor market than expectations of no change at 6.2%\nECB Governing Council member Centeno said the ECB \"is not in a hurry\" to cut interest rates further despite inflation being at its 2% target.\nECB Governing Council member Rehn said he's \"concerned about inflation being below the ECB's target for an extended period of time\" as the ECB is projecting 18 months of inflation below its goal due to US tariffs and the Eurozone economy's struggle to expand.\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 5% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the July 24 policy meeting.\nUS Stock Movers\nEarnings Reports (7/3/2025)\nMarketAxess Holdings Inc (MKTX).\nMore news from

Welcome to Motley Fool Money. I'm Andy Cross, joined here by Motley Fool contributor Jason Hall. On the docket today are earnings from Nike, Jason, Home Depot's latest acquisition, and we're lifting the hood on F1 The Movie and what it means for Apple. Jason, let's dive right into it. Nike's fourth quarter earnings were last week. The stock jumped 15% on that Friday after the footwear giant expressed confidence that it's turn around, that Elliott Hill, the CEO, who joined eight months ago, is moving along even though the quarter continues to show that challenge. Jason, is that investor enthusiasm warranted?\nJason Hall: Honestly, I think I would have framed it in a different way. The stock jumped on earnings, but if you look over the past five years, Nike stock has fallen after earnings far more often than it's gone up. The stock's still down a quarter from where it was five years ago, and it's down almost 60% from the high. I don't think this is about enthusiasm as much as it is investors reframing and resetting their expectations, and seeing the company with those lower expectations and the fact that this turnaround is going to take a while, there are some signs that it's starting to work.\nAndy Cross: Jason, the sales down 12% year over year, still ahead of some estimates, earnings per share were down 86%, beating consensus a little bit. The big thing was on the gross margins down 440 basis points to 40%. If you look a few quarters ago, gross margins were around 45%. We're seeing this impact on the inventories for Nike. I think that's a big story that investors are focused on with this turnaround.\nJason Hall: There's no doubt about it. One of the big parts of the Nike struggles over the past few years is trying to figure out their go-to-market strategy. They heavily prioritize their own digital channels, alienated a lot of the wholesale market, which is the retail channel, and they're having to come back around to that, a little bit with hat in hand, and they're starting to see a little bit of signs of improvement. We know that Dick's big acquisition that they're working on. With Foot Locker, that hopefully is going to be positive for Nike. Maybe the big thing is the e-commerce presence of finally accepting that they need to be part of the Amazon ecosystem. There's some limited release products that are going to be showing up there this fall. Those are things that the market wants to see. The company has to embrace customers wherever they are, and then try to have a little bit of exclusivity with its own e-commerce. I think that that's a successful formula. I think the market agrees too.\nAndy Cross: One thing, Jason, about their five \"Win Now\" principles, which is they're like, right now we are focused on Elliott Hill. Again, coming back in, he's a long term veteran, joined about eight months or so ago, trying to get the branding back for Nike Build Back, the Nike goodwill, focus on things like culture, product, marketing, the ground game being, as you were saying, where customers are on the ground, focusing in key sports, rightsizing those important brands that have those legacy brands. What I really like is they're restructuring the team and the whole focus back around sport chase, and they're focused back on cross-functional teams focused on specific sports. I think that is a really important focus for this Nike turnaround. While we're not seeing it in the earnings or the performance right now, I think that, what I consider enthusiasm, and I think the stock is actually pretty attractive here, even after that jump, I think the enthusiasm is warranted because of the way that Elliott Hill is going about refocusing the Nike brand, and importantly the Nike culture.\nJason Hall: I think that's right. Focusing on the brand, I'll start there. I've talked to a ton of people across sports that say that a lot of Nike's success right now is selling things that they were selling 30 years ago. Obviously, it's not exactly the truth, but it feels that way. They've certainly lost their innovative edge against on running other brands that have taken share, and having that hyper focus back on the products for that individual performance for that particular sport, I think is something that Nike has not done as well with. If they can show that and say, \"Look, we can still innovate. We can come out with products that are going to be better, not just the fit, but the performance,\" that's where Nike can reestablish itself as a leader.\nAndy Cross: It's interesting. They're going to do a little bit of surgical pricing, they mentioned, tied to Amazon a little bit later this fall. They do have a big tariff impact of about $1 billion because of all the sourcing they do overseas. Although they're trying to change that, they're going to move a little bit away from China, and they think as a percentage of sales that will drop going forward, but they do still have those impacts, and it's going to show up in the gross margin over the next quarter or two. But the expectations, Jason, is that it's going to improve throughout the year.\nJason Hall: That's right. Andy, everybody in apparel and footwear is dealing with the impact of tariffs, the potential impact. That story is going to continue to be part of the background for some time to come. I'm taking all of that with a grain of salt, that I think the supply chain is probably going to look more like it did five years ago than change going forward, but the company does have to take some financial steps to make sure it's prepared for whatever happens there.\nAndy Cross: Jason, how about the stock here, about $71, $106 billion market cap. You get a little dividend, 2.2%. Hopefully, bottomy on the earnings side that you look going forward are going to be meaningfully higher. Do you find this stock attractive?\nJason Hall: I do. I did a video for the Motley Fools website a couple of weeks ago, and I said that there were signs that the turnaround was working. We'd get more information once earnings came out, and they just did. Again, probably things are going to maybe take a little longer than we expected, but I think even with the stock up from where it was a couple of weeks ago, I think there are definitely signs that it's worth maybe starting a position, following things out in. It's not super cheap right now, but I think if the trend continues under Elliott's leadership, then this is going to work out to be a good price.\nAndy Cross: Certainly not on current earnings, but hopefully on the future earnings.\nJason Hall: Exactly.\nAndy Cross: In agreement there, I think Nike looks attractive here. After the break, Home Depot go shopping. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Specialty building products distributor GMS is up about 11% today after announcing that Home Depot had won the bidding battle to acquire the company for 5.5 billion. Jason, GMS has been on the auction block probably for the past month or so since QXO, another building products supplier and technology company, put out an offer for about $95 per share. Home Depot's paying $110 per share. Did Home Depot win the acquisition battle here but lose the capital allocation war?\nJason Hall: I think that's the question that I have. Home Depot, about a year ago, got into the distribution business that I think dropped $18 billion to buy a distributor, and part of the long term strategy was, look, this is an area we can consolidate, and these are builders and customers that are not coming into Home Depot no matter how well we work with them. It's big distribution. The plan had been to do that. Now, at the same time, you mentioned QXO, so that's Brad Jacobs. Brad Jacobs is the M&A master. This is somebody that has build a career on multibagger businesses, that he's made a lot of people a lot of money finding industries that are ripe for consolidation, that are low tech, that a layer of technology can make a tremendous amount better. QXO fired the opening salvo, as you said, with an unsolicited offer to buy GMS. Then Home Depot, we hear is getting involved. The question that I'm going to continue to ponder is, did Home Depot win it, or did Brad Jacobs and team just walk away because it got too pricey for them? If you look at the numbers, I believe 10 or 11 times EBITDA. Not crazy expensive, but certainly more expensive than the discipline price you would see a Jacobs-run business want to pay.\nAndy Cross: Sorry, about one times sales, as you mentioned, 10 to 11 times EBITDA. EBITDA's been down a little bit for the past year or so, but also because of the housing market, we know. But GMS, which by the way stands for Gypsum Management and Supply, runs 320 distribution centers selling things, including things like wallboard and ceilings, steel framings. It runs about 100 tool sales, rental, and service centers. Together, you're going to put together 1,200 locations, 8,000 trucks, making tens of thousand deliveries to job sites every day. What I like, Jason, as you mentioned, is these acquisitions for distribution scale matters, and this is a very fragmented business. I see this acquisition by Home Depot, this is a 5.5 billion dollar acquisition by Home Depot. Home Depot is a massive company, so Home Depot has about 45 billion of debt on the balance sheet. It's not going to add a ton more debt to the account. They have a $1.5 billion of cash, almost. I think from a management perspective, it's fairly attractive to Home Depot, and I can see why GMS would choose Home Depot versus QXO, even with Brad Jacobs' intelligence. But it does see when I look at the ability for Home Depot get a little bit more from every distribution node. I think it's attractive, and that multiple, as you mentioned, for Home Depot, I think, is not all that high. I think they're getting a good deal here.\nJason Hall: I think it probably works out so long as this remains a part of the strategy for Home Depot consolidating this fragmented distribution industry that's very different from its retail business. I will also make a prediction that Brad Jacobs and QXO made a big splash when they acquired Beacon Roofing as the first, looks like, $11 billion deal, so getting in the roofing business, one of the big roofing suppliers. My prediction is that we're going to see Home Depot and its distributor segment and Brad Jacobs' QXO going head to head on more acquisitions over the next 5-10 years, and probably both do well in consolidating because there's so much room to consolidate this market.\nAndy Cross: That's the thing. It's so fragmented, so I think they can both be winners here. Brad Jacobs, if you look at his acquisition or look at his history of running companies with XPO and others, have done very well over the years. Like you said, he has this down to a science, the Beacon Roofing acquisition. That SRS acquisition by Home Depot, as you mentioned, for a little bit more than $18 billion, got them back into the distribution game, and so they're trying to cobble up that together. Both of these companies are trying to serve the contractor market, which is, as we mentioned, very fragmented, trying to increase the value of that network. For Home Depot, I think it's a good acquisition, I think, at a reasonable price, and I think Brad Jacobs was like, \"Listen, there's going to be other opportunities. I'll let this one go. Home Depot, you can take this, and I'll focus my attention elsewhere.\" I do have a question, Jason, which is, if you think about either Home Depot stock or QXO stock, obviously GMS is going to be, if it all goes through, part of Home Depot, is there anyone that stands out as more attractive to you?\nJason Hall: There's my answer, and then there's the answer that people listening need to think about individually. For me, I think QXO is really attractive because I'm a big believer in Brad Jacobs and the track record, and the process when it comes to being disciplined and finding these industries to consolidate, starting from a really small size, this can be a massive compounder. Now, again, that's what I'm looking for. I think investors that are looking for maybe the higher floor of an industry dominant leader, like a Home Depot, that has a pretty solid dividend growth, and can continue to do well for investors over time, if you want something that's a little more stable, a little less volatile, then I think Home Depot's a pretty compelling investment right here. What about you? What do you think?\nAndy Cross: Well, QXO at $14 billion, I think the upside is a lot higher. I own Home Depot, it's a large position in my portfolio. The stock hasn't done all that well over the past year or so. I think this is a nice bolt-on acquisition for them. Doesn't add a ton more goodwill to the balance sheet, maybe 2.5 billion or so on top of their 20 billion they have. I think it's reasonable. I think it's a decent price. I think they'll be able to get more out of it and continue to grow the GMS side of the business tied to SRS. It's just that Home Depot, like you said, is probably the high single digit per year grow or not, one that's going to light anything on fire going forward, Home Depot that is.\nJason Hall: Well, their leverage is there is going to be buying back shares. That's how you boost per share return there too.\nAndy Cross: A hundred percent. Coming up next on Motley Fool Money, will F1 The Movie drive Apple stock higher? You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Brad Pitt's new movie F1, made by Apple Original Films, hit the theaters this weekend to positive reviews and decent amount of money, Jason. But here's my question, why is a $3 trillion company like Apple focused so much on making a film like F1, even with Brad Pitt.\nJason Hall: Because they can. They found the money on the couch cushions, and they saw it like a fun vanity project.\nAndy Cross: They don't want to buy back more stock, and they've got plenty of places to invest that capital.\nJason Hall: In all seriousness, we're both being a little bit glib here, and it's Apple TV+, and their studios business has actually created some exceptionally high quality content. It's still a bit of an also ran, compared to the big players in the space, like the Netflixes of the world, but to me, I think it's a reminder that Apple is focusing on quality more necessarily than quantity as part of its strategy with streaming and media content real large.\nAndy Cross: Does that mean the other ones are focused more on the quantity side, less on the quality side, do you think?\nJason Hall: I think a little bit both. I think all of them, there's a tension between the two, and it's where are you leveraging more toward. If you're a Netflix, for example, this is your entire business. You have to put out lots of content that's going to attract lots of people, and it's got to be very good quality. If you're an Apple, where does this fit in your entire ecosystem of things, and what you're looking to do maybe is a little bit different than say what Amazon is looking to do with Amazon Prime TV, or Amazon Prime Video, I should say. Where Apple does seem, if you look at the content that they've produced, certainly it doesn't have the volume that you see at some of these other large players, but what it does provide is an additional layer of stickiness to the platform.\nAndy Cross: Do you think that they will up the quantity game to be more competitive? I think about this with Apple, right? Stories and reports are surfacing, 200 million to 300 million more on the entire cost to make this film, and Apple financed a chunk of change of that. Are you saying they have exclusive rights once it hits Apple TV? They'll be there. They splash marketing budgets all over the place. They had it in Apple stores. They had it featured in Apple Music, Apple Maps app. They had a big marketing push toward it, obviously, to show that they can be competitive in this space. I'm thinking like this, Apple generates about $400 billion or so in revenue. They generate, gosh, $100 billion in profits. Almost about a quarter or so of their business is tied to services. When I think about Apple building out that ecosystem, Jason, and the glue that they're putting together, as you mentioned, things like streaming to be competitive against likes of not just Netflix, but also the likes of Amazon, and the likes of YouTube, for a company that has middling growing, that continued growth in the services side of the business is important. I think that's one reason why they are now recognizing that because they generate such great returns on their investment, this is a place they can splash some capital.\nJason Hall: Netflix here, they want your eyes, they need you. They need as much as many people's time as they can get because this is their entire business. Amazon wants your wallet, and the bottom line is that nobody's going to cancel or subscribe to Amazon Prime just for prime video. It's a bolt-on thing that keeps you in the ecosystem and drives you there. Now, if you're Apple, think about some of the things they've done with content. One example is they own the rights to the Charlie Brown content. Think about Ted Lasso, shows like this. I think where Amazon wants your wallet and Netflix wants your eyes, Apple want your heart. They want you drawn to these things that you remember from your childhood. Brad Pitt headline products are very compelling. Ted Lasso, it's become a cultural touchstone. I think if they focus more on those, almost like the HBO model of the 2000s, of developing just a few really high quality contents that are strong enough to keep you attached, that's where this fits in with Apple, and where Apple can win with this. Whether this part of the business is necessarily profitable on its own basis, I think eventually they want to see that. But if it creates value for the entire ecosystem, I think that's the most important thing for Apple here.\nAndy Cross: Is Apple attractive from a stock perspective? Again, I mentioned before, the growth has slowed. The stock has not been a super performer here, and now it sells in that 27-28 times earnings perspective, is with a lot of share buybacks, as you mentioned, in exceptionally profitable ways to invest, but still playing catch-up on the AI side. Is Apple attractive to you right now?\nJason Hall: Not at all. I love the business. I love the products. I'm a deep user of Apple products, and one of those people that signed up for Apple TV+ for Ted Lasso, and hasn't canceled it because there's so many other good unexpected programs that they have there. But the bigger concerns for me around a company like Apple's it's so fully valued, it's not growing. AI, I don't know that it's necessarily a concern right now, but at some point, they're trailing in that race for AI powered products, could potentially sneak up and hurt the company. They lack a real catalyst for the next leg of growth. Nothing is lined up to drive growth that would make 27, 28 times earnings or higher compelling to me. I think there's more risk of underperformance. I don't think investors are going to lose a ton of money here. There's a bigger risk of underperformance if you're making this a substantial portion of your portfolio.\nAndy Cross: I agree. I think it's probably more in the money making category than adding to here. I'm an owner of it, and I'm just sitting on my shares, but not one that jumps to the top of my buy list right now, Jason. I do want to see a little bit more innovation from them, yet to come. I like the movies, but I do want to see innovation into the product cycle. That's a wrap for us today here on Motley Fool Money.

    "title": "Strategy (MSTR) Is Interesting, but MSTY Is Better",
    "link": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/strategy-mstr-interesting-msty-better",
    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "content": "You can buy Strategy stock directly or invest in an ETF that offers exposure to Strategy stock via options.\nThe YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF is designed for investors who are seeking high monthly income and regular cash flow.\nWhile this ETF is tied to Strategy stock, it has a different risk-reward profile due to the use of options.\nDuring the past five years, Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) has been one of the top-performing stocks in the world. It's up a head-spinning 3,200% during that period. And it shows no signs of letting up anytime soon. Year to date, Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) is up 32%.\nBut here's the thing: If you want regular cash flow and a steady stream of high monthly income, those capital gains aren't going to help you. You will only generate income if you sell the stock.\nAs an alternative, you could invest in the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEMKT: MSTY). This exchange-traded fund (ETF) generates monthly income for investors using options tied to Strategy stock. There's a lot to unpack, so let's take a closer look.\nThe YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF is an investment product that offers extreme exposure to Strategy stock. You can think of it as a \"1-stock ETF,\" except that you don't actually own the underlying stock in the ETF. Instead, the ETF generates income by selling (i.e., \"writing\") call options on Strategy stock.\nThis income for the investor is measured in terms of distribution rate. This refers to the income generated by the ETF as a percentage of its net asset value. The higher the distribution rate, the more money you receive. Right now, the distribution rate of MSTY is 93%.\nThat's much higher than the distribution rates of other popular YieldMax ETFs. For example, the distribution rate of the YieldMax ETF for Tesla stock is 59%. The distribution rate of the YieldMax ETF for Apple stock is 32%.\nThis high distribution rate is the result of a nifty feat of financial alchemy that uses derivatives (i.e., options) to transform a non-yield-bearing asset (MSTR stock) into a yield-bearing asset (the MSTY ETF). In short, you're able to generate a yield from Strategy stock, even though it pays no dividends to investors. That's Wall Street magic.\nAs you might have guessed by now, there are some trade-offs involved. After all, on Wall Street, there is no such thing as a free lunch. So, in exchange for giving up some of the high upside potential of MSTR stock, you get a steady monthly income. The strategy is designed to work best when the price of MSTR is not expected to soar dramatically in value.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nThis is very important to keep in mind, since Strategy is highly leveraged to the price of Bitcoin. If the price of Bitcoin surges in value dramatically, then you could be losing out on some of the potential upside of holding MSTR stock. Yes, you will still be generating income and earning a regular yield via the ETF, but it might leave you feeling a bit disappointed, since you do not own shares in the company.\nOn the other hand, if the price of MSTR does not surge in value or falls only slightly, you should come out ahead, because people will still be buying call options on that stock. Thus, you will still be earning income.\nAs YieldMax advises potential investors, this ETF product is best for those who are neutral to moderately bullish on Strategy, and who want monthly income and regular cash flow. It should be used for diversification purposes, and should not compromise a significant portion of your overall portfolio.\nBefore investing in the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF, I would highly advise becoming familiar with call options, just to understand how they behave under different scenarios. At the very least, you should familiarize yourself with basic option payout charts.\nThis YieldMax ETF employs a covered call strategy, meaning any call option is written against a stock that is already owned. Technically, this YieldMax ETF employs a \"synthetic\" covered call strategy, since it uses a combination of different options to simulate a covered call position, without actually owning the underlying stock.\nAs an investor, all of this happens behind the scenes, and you don't need to know anything about options for the strategy to work. So, even though this might sound incredibly complex, YieldMax does all the heavy lifting for you.\nAt the end of the day, if you're hunting for some extra monthly income and are excited about generating some yield from an investment that normally does not offer any, then the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF could be worth a closer look.\nBefore you buy stock in Tidal Trust II - YieldMax Mstr Option Income Strategy ETF, consider this:\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $697,627!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $939,655!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,045% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 178% for the S&P 500.

    "title": "\"Magnificent Seven\" Makeover: Which Stocks Have Earned a Spot, and Which Haven't?",
    "link": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/magnificent-seven-makeover-which-stocks-have-earned-spot-and-which-havent",
    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "content": "The so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- Alphabet, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) -- provided much of the driving force behind the market's strong growth over the past several years. However, these tech stocks are seeing some uneven performance in 2025, and it may be time for this informal group -- first labeled by a Bank of America analyst in 2023 -- to get a makeover.\nI think it's time to give Apple and Tesla the boot and replace them with Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO).\nHere's why it should be out with the old and in with the new when it comes to the Magnificent Seven.\nImage source: Getty Images\nBoth Apple and Tesla stocks have had poor starts to 2025.\nThe reason for Apple's share price underperformance is that its revenue growth has slowed to a glacial pace, and investors' hopes for a strong smartphone upgrade cycle driven by its artificial intelligence (AI) offerings have faded. In fact, Apple's revenue of $391 billion for its fiscal 2024 (which ended in September) was less than the $394.3 billion it generated in its fiscal 2022. Through the first half of fiscal 2025, its revenue is up 4% year over year, but that is still a slow pace.\nA big part of Apple's issues is that it has not innovated. It has had no new breakout products in the last several years, and the company is behind in AI. While Apple dedicated a lot of resources to AI, it has thus far very little to show for it. Apple Intelligence's introduction did little to convince most users to upgrade their iPhones, and it hasn't even launched Apple Intelligence in China yet.\nThe Chinese market, meanwhile, remains a consistent weak spot for the company. Apple is losing smartphone market share to local rivals, and its revenue in the country has been on the decline. Xiaomi and Huawei have both launched smartphones to compete at the high-end of the market, and Apple has been forced to roll out sales incentives in China to try to spur demand. For a company that built its reputation not just as a technology company but as a luxury brand, that's a difficult path to go down.\nApple has been generating solid growth in its high-margin services business, but it faces a unique risk: It is possible that regulators and the courts may force Alphabet to end the deal that makes Google the default search engine on Apple devices. Alphabet currently pays Apple an estimated $20 billion a year for that privileged positioning, which is pure profit for Apple. Any change to the deal could result in a big hit to its earnings.\nTesla, meanwhile, has its own problems. Its electronic vehicle (EV) deliveries and revenue fell last year, and it looks like things are getting worse. In the first quarter, its EV deliveries sank by 13% while auto revenue dropped by 20%. In the second quarter, EV deliveries fell an even worse 14%.\nIncreased competition (especially in China) and the rising popularity of hybrid vehicles have played roles in Tesla's struggles, but some of the blame can also be pinned directly on the actions of CEO Elon Musk. Musk's support and financial backing of President Donald Trump and various Republicans in recent elections, and the subsequent leadership role he took on at Trump's \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (DOGE) have angered a lot of current and potential vehicle buyers. The constituencies Musk angered have political views that generally make them more likely to buy EVs than the demographic that supports President Trump.\nMusk's political actions led to protests and boycotts of Tesla in the U.S. and in several European countries where Tesla operates. More recently, Musk has become an outspoken critic of Trump's legislative efforts, irritating the president and his supporters. Musk even went so far as to threaten to start his own political party, potentially alienating all sides of the political spectrum. Not surprisingly, Tesla sales have been sinking in the U.S., Europe, and China.\nTesla bulls are still betting that its robotaxi business will be a game changer. However, the recent pilot launch of the service in its first city has been met with skepticism and some well-documented potential safety issues. Meanwhile, Alphabet's Waymo has established the early lead in the driverless ride-sharing race.\nIn my opinion, two of the best stocks to replace Apple and Tesla in the Magnificent Seven would be Palantir and Broadcom, both of which have had strong starts to the year.\nPalantir has become a growth machine. In Q1, it recorded its seventh straight quarter of accelerating revenue growth, with its top line climbing by 39% year over year. The greatest contributor to that growth was its largest customer -- the U.S. government. Revenue from federal government sources grew by 45% year over year (or about $116 million) to $373 million. Its sales to U.S. commercial customers grew at an even faster rate, but from a smaller base. They climbed by 71% (or about $106 million) to $255 million. Meanwhile, it recently landed a significant contract with NATO, showing that international defense has the potential to become a third meaningful growth pillar for the company.\nMuch of Palantir's success stems from its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which it is positioning to be an AI operating system for its clients. AIP gathers data from various sources and puts it into an \"ontology\" that connects digital assets with their real-world counterparts, allowing organizations to use AI to help solve their real-world problems.\nThe platform is already being used by clients across a wide swath of industries to manage an array of different issues, and the opportunities for it appear to be huge. Meanwhile, Palantir recently introduced new agentic AI tools that not only suggest actions but can also carry them out.\nBroadcom has also been seeing solid growth. Last quarter, its revenue climbed 20% year over year while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) soared 44%.\nThe growth is being led by its AI networking portfolio, where it provides networking components such as Ethernet switches, optical receivers, DSPs, and NICs -- critical hardware for moving huge amounts of data across AI clusters. Last quarter, its AI networking revenue surged 70%.\nHowever, Broadcom's biggest opportunity lies in custom AI chips. The company helps customers design application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that can be used to power AI workloads. After its success in helping Alphabet design its tensor processing units (TPUs), Broadcom has been gaining more and more new custom AI chip customers.\nThree of its hyperscaler customers are well advanced in the ASIC design process, and Broadcom has stated that each one of them intends to deploy fabrics of 1 million AI chip clusters in 2027, representing a total serviceable opportunity for the company of $60 billion to $90 billion in that year alone. That's a huge opportunity, and it doesn't even include Broadcom's newer customers, such as Apple.\nGiven the growth opportunities ahead for both Broadcom and Palantir, they look today like better candidates than Apple or Tesla to form a new and improved Magnificent Seven.\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $697,627!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $939,655!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,045% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 178% for the S&P 500.

    "link": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-are-10-hottest-stocks-robinhood-heres-best-and-worst-bunch",
    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "content": "The popular online brokerage Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ: HOOD) pioneered commission-free trading, a move that greatly expanded access to retail investors and a trend that ultimately spread throughout the industry.\nWith stocks now easier to buy and with fewer associated fees, retail investors have become an influential part of the market, making up a larger portion of total flows than they once did. According to a retail investing report by the investing platform Public, retail investors accounted for a quarter of all equities trading volume in 2021, nearly double the percentage from a decade prior.\nRobinhood regularly releases data on the most popular holdings on the platform, implying the highest conviction among retail investors. In this article, I'll take a look at the 10 hottest stocks on Robinhood as of June 2, along with assessments of which are the best and worst of the bunch.\nRobinhood created the Robinhood Investor Index to show which stocks investors on the platform have the highest conviction in. The information is likely helpful for the entire stock market because retail flows have become very influential.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nThe index tracks the performance of the top 100 most-owned investments (in aggregate) on Robinhood. Investments that make the index are weighted by conviction, meaning Robinhood is looking at the percentage of each investment in portfolios. To ensure customers from all socioeconomic classes are represented, Robinhood takes the average conviction for each investment regardless of the size of their account.\nHere are the top 10 most popular investments on Robinhood as of June 2:\n1. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n2. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\n3. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\n4. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\n5. Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F)\n6. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\n7. Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR)\n8. GameStop (NYSE: GME)\n9. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\n10. Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS)\nIn my mind, the worst of the top 10 stocks in the index is easily GameStop, but it also doesn't surprise me to see GameStop on this list. The meme-stock frenzy of 2020 and 2021 was heavily centered around GameStop and is likely part of the reason so many retail investors began investing in the first place. It likely got many people to invest for the first time, whether people were looking to strike it big or just join in the fun and have some skin in the game. Many investors who began with GameStop started on Robinhood and then kept their accounts active.\nDespite its magical run during the pandemic, I see very little fundamental value in the stock. GameStop at its core is a video-game-centric, brick-and-mortar business, and retail foot traffic is not nearly as robust as it once was -- most people buy video games online now. While GameStop has shrunk its brick-and-mortar footprint and tried to ramp up other businesses like trading cards, revenue still fell meaningfully in the company's first fiscal quarter of 2025.\nRecently, GameStop took a page out of MicroStrategy's playbook and began issuing debt that it can use the proceeds from to buy Bitcoin. However, I'm not convinced this will save the day because several companies are now using this strategy. How will GameStop ultimately differentiate itself? This strategy also essentially turns companies into a levered play on Bitcoin, which I think is too risky for most investors to engage in.\nThere are several good stocks investors can buy from Robinhood's top 10. However, right now, I think Microsoft is the best of the bunch.\nMicrosoft is a highly diversified tech conglomerate that now has many tremendous businesses under its umbrella, including its Azure and cloud business, gaming, its suite of office products that power the business world, and exposure to social media through LinkedIn.\nMicrosoft is well-positioned to take advantage of artificial intelligence (AI). Azure and other cloud-services revenue grew 35% year over year in the company's third quarter of its fiscal year 2025. Azure provides many services. Its global network of data services allows businesses to store data in the cloud. Additionally, Azure offers thousands of AI language learning models (LLMs) businesses can use to build and run AI solutions and applications.\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives, in a recent research note on the stock, said Microsoft is \"playing chess, and others are playing checkers.\" Ives thinks Microsoft is about to see a massive wave of adoption and monetization of its Azure AI services by customers. Ives raised his price target on Microsoft to $600, implying 22% upside from current levels (as of June 26). That would make Microsoft a $5 trillion company.\nAnother factor that makes Microsoft a buy is the fact that it is one of two companies with a higher credit rating than the U.S. government.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $697,627!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $939,655!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,045% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 178% for the S&P 500.

    "title": "Stocks Mixed on Weak US Labor Market News",
    "link": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stocks-mixed-weak-us-labor-market-news",
    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "content": "Stock indexes today are mixed.  Apple and Tesla are up more than +2% today to lead technology stocks higher.  However, gains in the broader market are limited by concern that the US labor market is weakening after the June ADP employment report showed that employment at US companies unexpectedly declined for the first time in more than two years.  Weakness in health insurance stocks is also weighing on the overall market, led by a -37% plunge in Centene after it withdrew its 2025 guidance due to insurance market trends that differed from its initial assumptions.\nThe markets are awaiting a House vote on the Senate version of President Trump’s tax and spending bill.  Also, trade talks are in focus ahead of the July 9 deadline for reciprocal tariff implementation.  Late Tuesday, President Trump said a trade deal with Japan is unlikely, so the country will most likely pay a tariff of 30%, 35% or “whatever the number is that we determine.”\nOn Tuesday, the Senate passed the Republican reconciliation bill by a 51-50 vote.  The bill is now being considered by the House, where a vote is expected sometime this week.  Speaker Johnson said the House “will work quickly” to pass the bill by July 4.  The reconciliation bill has the debt ceiling hike that is necessary to avert a Treasury default when the Treasury runs out of borrowing authority sometime between mid-August and late September.  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would add nearly $3.3 trillion to US budget deficits over the next decade.\nUS MBA mortgage applications rose +2.7% in the week ended June 27, with the purchase mortgage sub-index up +0.1% and the refinancing mortgage sub-index up +6.5%. The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell -9 bp to 6.79% from 6.88% in the prior week.\nThe US June ADP employment change unexpectedly fell -33,000, weaker than expectations of a +98,000 increase and the first decline in 2-1/4 years.\nOn the negative side for stocks is the upcoming earnings season, which begins next week. Bloomberg Intelligence data show that the consensus for Q2 earnings of S&P 500 companies is for a rise of +2.8% year-over-year, the smallest increase in two years.  Also, only six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research.\nDuring this holiday-shortened week, the markets will look for additional trade and tariff news along with progress in the possible passage of President Trump’s tax bill.  On Thursday, June nonfarm payrolls are expected to climb by +113,000, and the June employment rate is expected to tick up +0.1 to 4.3%.  Also, June average hourly earnings are expected to rise +0.3% m/m and +3.8% y/y. In addition, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb +5,000 to 241,000, and May factory orders are expected to jump +8.1% m/m.  Finally, the June ISM services index is expected to climb +0.7 to 50.6.\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances at 23% for a -25 bp rate cut at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting.\nOverseas stock markets today are mixed.  The Euro Stoxx 50 is up +0.36%.

    "content": "Stock indexes today are mostly higher.  Strength in semiconductor makers today is leading the broader market higher.  Also, Apple and Tesla are climbing more than +2% today to lead megacap technology stocks higher.  Stocks added to their gains after President Trump announced that the US had reached a trade deal with Vietnam.\nHowever, gains in the broader market are limited by concerns that the US labor market is weakening, following the June ADP employment report, which showed that employment at US companies unexpectedly declined for the first time in more than two years.  Weakness in health insurance stocks is also weighing on the overall market, led by a -38% plunge in Centene after it withdrew its 2025 guidance due to insurance market trends that differed from its initial assumptions.\nThe markets are awaiting a House vote on the Senate version of President Trump’s tax and spending bill.  Also, trade talks are in focus ahead of the July 9 deadline for reciprocal tariff implementation.  Late Tuesday, President Trump said a trade deal with Japan is unlikely, so the country will most likely pay a tariff of 30%, 35%, or “whatever the number is that we determine.”\nOn Tuesday, the Senate passed the Republican reconciliation bill by a 51-50 vote.  The bill is now being considered by the House, where a vote is expected sometime this week.  Speaker Johnson said the House “will work quickly” to try to pass the bill by July 4.  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would add nearly $3.3 trillion to US budget deficits over the next decade.  The reconciliation bill has the debt ceiling hike that is necessary to avert a Treasury default when the Treasury runs out of borrowing authority on the so-called X-date, which is sometime between mid-August and late September.\nUS MBA mortgage applications rose +2.7% in the week ended June 27, with the purchase mortgage sub-index up +0.1% and the refinancing mortgage sub-index up +6.5%. The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell -9 bp to 6.79% from 6.88% in the prior week.\nUS June ADP employment unexpectedly fell -33,000, weaker than expectations of a +98,000 increase and the first decline in 2-1/4 years.\nOn the negative side for stocks is the upcoming earnings season, which begins next week. Bloomberg Intelligence data show that the consensus for Q2 earnings of S&P 500 companies is for a rise of +2.8% year-over-year, the smallest increase in two years.  Also, only six of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research.\nDuring this holiday-shortened week, the markets will look for additional trade and tariff news along with progress in the possible passage of President Trump’s tax bill.  On Thursday, June nonfarm payrolls are expected to climb by +113,000, and the June employment rate is expected to tick up +0.1 to 4.3%.  Also, June average hourly earnings are expected to rise +0.3% m/m and +3.8% y/y. In addition, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb +5,000 to 241,000, and May factory orders are expected to jump +8.1% m/m.  Finally, the June ISM services index is expected to climb +0.7 to 50.6.\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances at 25% for a -25 bp rate cut at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting.\nOverseas stock markets today are mixed.  The Euro Stoxx 50 is up +0.65%.  China’s Shanghai Composite closed down -0.09%.  Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.56%.\nInterest Rates\nT-notes are under pressure
