    "content": "MongoDB’s MDB Atlas has become a central pillar of the company’s platform strategy. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, MongoDB highlighted strong adoption of Atlas across industries, including customers like CSX and LG Uplus, which are leveraging the platform for real-time operations and AI capabilities. The company saw its highest total customer net additions in over six years, driven primarily by Atlas, with self-serve channels contributing significantly to growth.In the fiscal first quarter, total revenues were $549 million, up 22% year over year. Atlas revenues grew 26% and accounted for 72% of total revenues, compared to 70% in the prior year. Atlas customer count reached over 55,800, up from 47,700 a year ago. MongoDB expects Atlas to continue playing a key role in its long-term strategy. For fiscal 2026, Atlas growth is embedded in the company’s raised revenue guidance of $2.25–$2.29 billion, reflecting continued confidence in its performance. Subscription revenues make up the vast majority of MongoDB’s business, with Atlas serving as the core component of this segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MongoDB’s subscription revenues for the fiscal second quarter is pegged at $537.5 million, with the estimate for Atlas customers pinned at roughly 55,863.To support future growth, MongoDB is expanding its efforts in application modernization and AI. The company recently acquired Voyage AI and plans to enable users to generate embeddings directly from data within MongoDB. MongoDB is also hiring experienced enterprise leaders, investing in developer training and certifications, and enhancing self-serve tools to drive greater Atlas adoption.\nMongoDB faces growing competition from Amazon’s AMZN DynamoDB and Couchbase BASE, both of which are expanding their presence in the cloud database market.Amazon’s DynamoDB has added multi-region strong consistency to its Global Tables, letting apps read and write data across AWS regions with the same accuracy. This makes Amazon’s DynamoDB stronger in the cloud database space, especially for apps that need high reliability.Couchbase launched a new version of its cloud database using Memory-First Computing Platform to support AI agent workflows. This lets large language models take actions directly on Couchbase clusters. It’s designed for smarter, real-time systems and supports a future of connected, AI-powered tools.\nMDB shares have lost 8.7% in the year-to-date (YTD) period, underperforming the Zacks Internet – Software industry’s growth of 14.3% and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 6.9%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, MongoDB stock is currently trading at a  forward 12 months Price/Sales ratio of 6.89X compared with the industry’s 5.74X.

It helps reduce operational costs for patching vulnerabilities through fast response times and higher efficiency for securing all systems, freeing up IT resources and manpower, which then can be used for other productive purposes. Using the IBM Watsonx platform, the fully automated patching process for operating systems has been designed to reduce patching time from 90 minutes to a maximum of 20 minutes.

This has resulted in heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies, which, in turn, have led firms to undertake a cloud-agnostic and interoperable approach to highly secure multi-cloud management. IBM is poised to benefit from healthy demand trends for hybrid cloud and AI, which drive the Software and Consulting segments. The company’s growth is expected to be aided by analytics, cloud computing and security in the long term.

    "title": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Walmart vs. Amazon",
    "link": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/best-stock-buy-right-now-walmart-vs-amazon-1",
    "ticker": "AMZN",
    "content": "Two popular stocks that some investors might have on their radar right now are the retail juggernaut Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and e-commerce leader Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Both companies offer investors exposure to retail spending, and each has managed to dominate its niche, becoming fantastic long-term investments along the way. But which one looks like the better stock to buy right now?\nLet's look at the case for both to see why this matchup looks pretty even across the board.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nWalmart's stock has been on a tear lately, skyrocketing 44% over the past year. Those gains come as the company continues to dominate the retail market, increase sales and earnings, and expand its services. Walmart's revenue rose about 5% in fiscal 2025 (which ended Jan. 31) to $681 billion, and its non-GAAP earnings rose 26% to $2.41 per share.\nThe company's e-commerce sales surged 20% in the U.S., proving that Walmart is successfully expanding its business beyond its brick-and-mortar locations. It is also seeing strong growth from its advertising segment (up 24% in the U.S.).\nOne of the biggest draws of owning Walmart stock is that its business is nearly recession-proof. The company holds about 21% of the grocery market in the U.S., and even during tough times, Americans buy groceries. There's also evidence that higher-income shoppers are moving toward Walmart as well, as they look for better deals in an uncertain economy.\nWith its strong position in retail, groceries, and its impressive sales and earnings, there's a lot to like about Walmart stock. Add to all of this the fact that Walmart pays a 1% dividend yield and has raised its dividend annually for over 50 years, and it's easy to see why this value stock is a mainstay in so many portfolios.\nAmazon is an equally popular consumer goods stock, but the company has several business segments that have little to do with consumer goods, but a lot to do with the profits the company makes. For example, its North American e-commerce revenue accounts for about 61% of overall revenue last year, but just 36% of operating income. Meanwhile, the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing segment accounted for almost 17% of overall revenue, but it brought in about 58% of all operating income.\nAmazon controls about 30% of the cloud computing market, and it's an important business for Amazon, considering that artificial intelligence could push global cloud computing sales up to $2 trillion over the next five years. It is also making multiple investments in AI that are likely to pay off (and already paying off in some cases) in the coming years.\nAnd then there's Amazon's fastest-growing business: Advertising. Sales from this high-margin segment popped 18% year over year in the first quarter (which ended March 31) and generated nearly $14 billion in revenue. Amazon is benefiting from its massive e-commerce platform of more than 200 million Prime members, which will likely continue to attract a lot of ad dollars in the future. eMarketer estimates Amazon could take 17% of the digital ad market in 2026, up from 11% in 2021.\nWhile Amazon doesn't pay a dividend, the company does have impressive financial growth. Total revenue rose 11% to $638 billion in 2024, and its non-GAAP earnings per share jumped 91% to $5.53. The company also ended the year with $38.2 billion in free cash flow, an increase of about 4% from the previous year.\nBoth Amazon and Walmart deserve a place in your portfolio, but deciding which one is better for you depends on what type of stock you're looking for. If you want to invest in a company that's essentially recession-proof and that has a long history of consistent (and growing) dividend payments, then Walmart is a no-brainer choice. On the other hand, if you want a strong e-commerce growth stock that's also benefiting from cloud computing, AI, and advertising, then go with Amazon.\nWalmart has a price-to-earnings ratio of about 41, while Amazon's is about 36. That's not much of a difference when it comes to deciding which is the better value. Which means that if you have enough to buy both stocks right now, it's probably a smart move. If not, then pick the one that best fits your investment goals.\nBefore you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $697,627!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $939,655!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,045% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 178% for the S&P 500.

    "title": "Amazon Is Going to Offer Fast Delivery in Rural Areas. Should Dollar General Investors Be Worried?",
    "link": "https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amazon-going-offer-fast-delivery-rural-areas-should-dollar-general-investors-be-worried",
    "ticker": "AMZN",
    "content": "Targeting rural areas has enabled Dollar General (NYSE: DG) to generate solid growth for years. Going into markets big-box retailers avoided has allowed it to be the one-stop shop for consumers in those areas.\nBut what if shoppers had a different option to consider for low-priced consumer goods? That could soon be a reality as e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is looking to offer fast delivery options to many rural markets across the country.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nOnline shopping is not a new phenomenon or threat to Dollar General by any means. Rural shoppers can shop for goods online just like anyone else -- but delivery may take longer. If you need something right away, buying online is not going to be a realistic option in those cases, which is why Dollar General has been able to succeed even amid a flurry of online shopping options.\nBut Amazon isn't just planning to offer delivery in more areas next year, it's going to offer same-day and next-day delivery to 4,000 small cities, towns, and communities. This means that in some rural communities, customers could receive deliveries within hours. That's the kind of competition Dollar General hasn't had to worry about from online marketplaces. And this is why the Amazon threat is a considerable one.\nAmazon is also utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to help predict which items it needs to stock in specific communities, which can better position the company for success as it expands into small towns.\nDollar General offers same-day delivery to its customers, so it won't exactly be caught flat-footed with Amazon's latest expansion plans. But it's now facing a mammoth competitor in Amazon, which could conceivably take market share.\nThe dollar store retailer may lose sales and it may need to become more aggressive in price, which would cut into its already thin margins.\nDG Profit Margin data by YCharts\nDollar General has already been struggling with declining margins in recent years, and now, potentially heightened competition could exacerbate the current situation.\nAmazon is investing billions to build its network in a fairly short time frame and that isn't going to be easy for Dollar General to compete with. With Amazon's attention to detail and AI-powered analytics, odds are it's going to go after the most profitable and lucrative rural markets, which could hit Dollar General the hardest. That's why I definitely think the retail stock could be in deep trouble in the future.\nDollar General's core customer has been struggling to even buy the bare essentials of late. And while higher-income shoppers are spending more at Dollar General in light of worsening economic conditions, the company's growth prospects don't look great in the near term. For the current fiscal year (which ends in January), Dollar General is anticipating comparable sales growth between 1.5% and 2.5%.\nAnd now, thanks to Amazon, even its long-term growth prospects may not be all that strong.\nThere isn't much room for error in Dollar General's operations given its thin margins. And the business could feel the squeeze once Amazon starts rolling out faster delivery options to rural areas. It introduces a new risk for an already risky stock in Dollar General. I don't like its odds of success in competing against Amazon, which is why I'd avoid Dollar General stock as its fundamentals could get even worse in the years ahead.\nBefore you buy stock in Dollar General, consider this:\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $697,627!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $939,655!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,045% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 178% for the S&P 500.
