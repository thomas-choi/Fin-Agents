# Mixture of Experts Architecture for Trading Signal Generation

## Overview
The Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework integrates predictions from specialized models (experts) to generate a consolidated trading signal for a stock or stock option. The experts predict distinct aspects: trend (e.g., up, down, neutral), support/resistance levels (e.g., price levels), and volatility (e.g., expected price fluctuation). A gating network dynamically weights each expertâ€™s contribution based on input features, and their outputs are combined to produce a trading signal (e.g., buy, sell, hold, or a continuous score for position sizing). This document provides detailed diagrams to illustrate the MoE architecture, focusing on the overall structure, gating network, and combination methods.

## Overall MoE Architecture
### Description
The MoE framework consists of three experts (trend, support/resistance, volatility), a gating network, and a combiner. Each expert processes tailored input data to produce predictions. The gating network assigns weights to each expert based on shared input features (e.g., market conditions). The combiner aggregates the weighted expert outputs to generate a trading signal.

```

### Explanation
- **Inputs**: Shared features (e.g., market volatility, stock volume) are fed to both experts and the gating network.
- **Experts**: Each produces a specialized prediction (categorical probabilities for trend, numerical levels for support/resistance, numerical value for volatility).
- **Gating Network**: Outputs weights for each expert, reflecting their relevance.
- **Combiner**: Aggregates expert outputs using weights to produce a trading signal.
- **Output**: A categorical signal (e.g., buy) or continuous score.

## Gating Network Detail
### Description
The gating network is a model (e.g., neural network) that processes input features to produce weights for each expert. The weights sum to 1 (e.g., using a softmax function) and determine the contribution of each expert to the final trading signal.

    D --> E[Trend Expert]
    D --> F[Support/Resistance Expert]
    D --> G[Volatility Expert]
```

### Explanation
- **Input Features**: Market conditions (e.g., VIX index), stock-specific data (e.g., trading volume), or sentiment (e.g., from X posts).
- **Neural Network**: Processes features to learn which experts are most relevant.
- **Softmax Layer**: Normalizes outputs to produce weights summing to 1.
- **Output**: Weights assigned to each expert, used by the combiner.

## Combination Methods
### Description
The combiner can use different methods to aggregate expert outputs into a trading signal. Three approaches are illustrated: rule-based, weighted score, and meta-model.

#### 1. Rule-Based Combination
##### Description
Predefined rules map expert outputs to a trading signal based on conditions (e.g., buy if trend is up, price is near support, and volatility is low).

##### Diagram
```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Trend: P(Up)=0.7"] --> D[Rule-Based Combiner]
    B["S/R: Support=$50, Price=$51"] --> D
    C["Volatility: 2%"] --> D
    F["Gating Weights: [0.4, 0.3, 0.2]"] --> D
    D --> E["Rules: If P(Up)>0.6 & Price near Support & Volatility<3%, then Buy"]
    E --> G["Trading Signal: Buy"]
```

#### 2. Weighted Score Combination
##### Description
Expert outputs are normalized and combined into a weighted sum using gating weights. The score is mapped to a trading signal or used for position sizing.

##### Diagram
```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Trend: Score=+0.7 (Up)"] --> D[Weighted Sum]
    B["S/R: Score=+0.5 (Near Support)"] --> D
    C["Volatility: Score=-0.2 (Low)"] --> D
    F["Gating Weights: [0.4, 0.3, 0.2]"] --> D
    D --> E["Score = 0.4*0.7 + 0.3*0.5 + 0.2*(-0.2) = 0.39"]
    E --> G["Trading Signal: Buy (Score > 0.3)"]
```

#### 3. Meta-Model Combination
##### Description
Expert outputs and gating weights are fed into a meta-model (e.g., logistic regression) trained to predict the optimal trading signal.

    A["Trend: P(Up)=0.7, P(Down)=0.2, P(Neutral)=0.1"] --> D[Meta-Model]
    B["S/R: Support=$50, Resistance=$55"] --> D
    C["Volatility: 2%"] --> D
    F["Gating Weights: [0.4, 0.3, 0.2]"] --> D
    D --> E["Trading Signal: Buy"]
```

## Implementation Details
1. **Expert Models**:
   - **Trend Expert**: Classification model (e.g., LSTM, XGBoost) trained on historical prices and technical indicators.
   - **Support/Resistance Expert**: Regression model (e.g., SVR) trained on price action and pivot points.
   - **Volatility Expert**: Regression model (e.g., GARCH) trained on historical volatility and option data.
2. **Gating Network**:
   - Neural network with softmax output to produce weights [w1, w2, w3].
   - Train on validation data to optimize trading performance (e.g., Sharpe ratio).
3. **Combination Methods**:
   - **Rule-Based**: Define rules based on domain knowledge (e.g., buy if P(Up) > 0.6, price within 1% of support, volatility < 3%).
   - **Weighted Score**: Normalize outputs (e.g., trend: +1 for up, -1 for down; S/R: +1 if near support, -1 if near resistance; volatility: negative if high). Compute weighted sum and threshold for signal.
   - **Meta-Model**: Train a model (e.g., logistic regression) on expert outputs and historical trading outcomes.
4. **Normalization**:
   - Convert trend probabilities to a score (e.g., +1 for up, -1 for down).
   - Normalize support/resistance (e.g., distance from current price) and volatility (e.g., z-score).
5. **Training**:
   - Train experts independently on their respective datasets.
   - Train gating network and meta-model (if used) on a validation set.

## Considerations
- **Calibration**: Ensure trend probabilities and numerical predictions are calibrated.
- **Weight Tuning**: Optimize gating weights using historical data or Bayesian methods.
- **Evaluation**: Backtest trading signals on historical stock/option data.
- **Real-Time Data**: Optionally integrate real-time market sentiment from X posts.
- **Risk Management**: Use volatility predictions to adjust position sizes or option strategies.

## Next Steps
- Define specific input features for experts and gating network.
- Implement MoE in Python using TensorFlow (gating network) and scikit-learn (experts).
- Backtest on historical data to refine rules, weights, or meta-model.
- Optionally, incorporate real-time data for dynamic predictions.
