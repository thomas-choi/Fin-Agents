# Ensemble Architecture for Stock Trend Prediction

## Overview
The goal is to combine predictions from multiple models, each trained on different input data, to predict the next day's stock trend (e.g., up, down, neutral). These models, leveraging diverse data sources, produce either class predictions or probabilities. Ensemble methods are used to consolidate these predictions into a single, robust prediction, improving accuracy and reducing variance. The following sections describe the architecture for six ensemble methods: Majority Voting, Weighted Voting, Soft Voting, Stacking, Bayesian Model Averaging, and Threshold-Based Combination.

Each method is illustrated with a diagram created using mermaid.js, showing the flow from individual model predictions to the final consolidated prediction.

## 1. Majority Voting (Hard Voting)
### Description
Each model outputs a discrete class prediction (e.g., up, down, neutral). The final prediction is the class with the most votes across all models. Ties can be resolved by a predefined rule (e.g., default to "neutral").

### Architecture
- **Input**: Class predictions from each model.
- **Process**: Count votes for each class and select the class with the highest count.
- **Output**: Single class prediction.

    B[Model 2: Predicts 'Down'] --> D
    C[Model 3: Predicts 'Up'] --> D
    D --> E[Final Prediction: 'Up']
```

## 2. Weighted Voting
### Description
Similar to majority voting, but each model's vote is weighted based on its performance (e.g., validation accuracy). The class with the highest weighted vote sum is selected.

### Architecture
- **Input**: Class predictions and model weights (e.g., based on accuracy).
- **Process**: Sum the weights of models predicting each class and select the class with the highest weighted sum.
- **Output**: Single class prediction.

### Diagram

    A[Model 1: Predicts 'Up', Weight 0.4] --> D[Weighted Vote Aggregator]
    B[Model 2: Predicts 'Down', Weight 0.3] --> D
    C[Model 3: Predicts 'Up', Weight 0.2] --> D
    D --> E[Final Prediction: 'Up']
```

## 3. Soft Voting (Averaging Probabilities)
### Description
Each model outputs probabilities for each class (up, down, neutral). The probabilities are averaged (or weighted-averaged) across models, and the class with the highest average probability is selected.

### Architecture
- **Input**: Probability distributions from each model.
- **Process**: Compute the average probability for each class and select the class with the highest average.
- **Output**: Single class prediction.

### Diagram
```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Model 1: [0.7 Up, 0.2 Down, 0.1 Neutral]"] --> D[Probability Averager]
    B["Model 2: [0.6 Up, 0.3 Down, 0.1 Neutral]"] --> D
    C["Model 3: [0.5 Up, 0.4 Down, 0.1 Neutral]"] --> D
    D --> E["Final Prediction: 'Up' (Avg: [0.6, 0.3, 0.1])"]
```

## 4. Stacking (Meta-Model)
### Description
Predictions (or probabilities) from individual models are used as features to train a meta-model, which makes the final prediction. The meta-model learns to combine base model outputs optimally.

### Architecture
- **Input**: Predictions or probabilities from base models.
- **Process**: Feed base model outputs into a trained meta-model (e.g., logistic regression).
- **Output**: Single class prediction from the meta-model.

### Diagram
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Model 1: Predicts 'Up'] --> D[Meta-Model]
    B[Model 2: Predicts 'Down'] --> D
    C[Model 3: Predicts 'Up'] --> D
    D --> E[Final Prediction: 'Up']
```

## 5. Bayesian Model Averaging
### Description
Each modelâ€™s prediction is weighted by its posterior probability (based on performance or uncertainty). Probabilities are combined using Bayesian principles to produce a final prediction.

### Architecture
- **Input**: Probability distributions and model posterior weights.
- **Process**: Compute weighted average of probabilities, where weights reflect model reliability.
- **Output**: Single class prediction based on highest weighted probability.

### Diagram
```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Model 1: P(UP) =0.7, P(Down)=0.2, P(Neutral)=0.1, Posterior 0.5"] --> D[Bayesian Combiner]
    B["Model 2: P(Up)=0.6, P(Down)=0.3, P(Neutral)=0.1, Posterior 0.3"] --> D
    C["Model 3: P(Up)=0.5, P(Down)=0.4, P(Neutral)=0.1, Posterior 0.2"] --> D
    D --> E[Final Prediction: Up]
```

## 6. Threshold-Based Combination
### Description
Probabilities are averaged across models, and the final prediction is made only if the highest average probability exceeds a threshold (e.g., 0.6). Otherwise, a default class (e.g., "neutral") is predicted.

### Architecture
- **Input**: Probability distributions from each model.
- **Process**: Compute average probabilities and apply a threshold to select the class.
- **Output**: Single class prediction or default class if threshold not met.

### Diagram
```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Model 1: [0.7 Up, 0.2 Down, 0.1 Neutral]"] --> D[Probability Averager]
    B["Model 2: [0.6 Up, 0.3 Down, 0.1 Neutral]"] --> D
    C["Model 3: [0.5 Up, 0.4 Down, 0.1 Neutral]"] --> D
    D --> E{"Threshold Check: <br> Avg [0.6, 0.3, 0.1] > 0.6?"}
    E -->|No| F[Final Prediction: Neutral]
    E -->|Yes| G[Final Prediction: Up]
```

## Implementation Considerations
- **Model Calibration**: Ensure probabilities are calibrated for methods like Soft Voting, Bayesian Model Averaging, and Threshold-Based Combination using techniques like Platt scaling or isotonic regression.
- **Weight Tuning**: For Weighted Voting and Bayesian Model Averaging, weights should be derived from validation performance or Bayesian inference.
- **Meta-Model Training**: Stacking requires a separate validation dataset to train the meta-model to avoid overfitting.
- **Threshold Selection**: For Threshold-Based Combination, the threshold should be tuned based on historical data to balance confidence and prediction frequency.
- **Evaluation**: Test each ensemble method on a holdout set to compare performance (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).

## Next Steps
- Select an ensemble method based on model output types (class vs. probabilities) and computational resources.
- Implement the chosen method using a programming framework (e.g., Python with scikit-learn for voting/stacking, or PyMC3 for Bayesian averaging).
- Validate the ensemble on historical stock data to optimize weights or thresholds.
